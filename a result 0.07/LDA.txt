5 5 my son loves this one and will only sleep if he has this one 
5 5 perfect
5 5 amazing addition to the nursery 
5 5 great breathable and basic pacifier

3 3 the bear does exactly what we ordered it to do the heartbeat womb sounds helped our first daughter to sleep and she still sleeps with her heartbeat bear she s almost 3 and this is baby number 2 s i do wish the volume could be turned down more the bear is also a darker chocolate brown than i anticipated based off the items picture which was disappointing for me edit once the womb noise times out restarting it is a hassle just turning the switch to off and then back on does not work it requires turning the switch to off multiple times to get it restart the womb noise sometimes it takes two times sometimes it takes seven it s not reliable and i wish i would have purchased a different heartbeat bear 
5 5 baby boy loves it and like to just hold the giraffe happy kid happy parents
5 5 we love the nuk brand of bottles and pacifiers and these pacifiers are no exception these are the only brand my kiddos would take with how easy these can be to lose this 4 pack is so worth buying the colors are exactly as pictured would recommend buying the pacifiers and bottles together because baby recognizes the nipple and will take them easier love the othodonic shape its more natural to breastfed babies and i don t have to worry about teeth problems would definitely recommend this product 
5 5 went well with the baby one piece tuxedo excellent
5 5 perfect love 
5 4 he likes them over all the others and that s what matters 
5 5 these are the only type of pacifier that my baby will take they stay in his mouth really well compared to other brands we tried he loves them 
5 5 very cute
5 5 love these the shape of them allows my daughter to get a good suction and they stay in her mouth 
4 4 i do not like these pacifiers the only reason i gave it a high rating is that the animal attached helps the pacifier stay in my child s mouth 
5 5 good
5 5 this is hands down the best baby monitor on the market we ve had it for 9 months with no problems the camera can move side to side and even zoom there is a microphone so you can speak to your baby if you want to the screen can time out lighten or darken and you can use more than one monitor while using 1 screen we have also dropped this screen on multiple occasions and it has survived with no scratches this is the monitor you will want 
1 1 giant way too big sizing is way off needed to be returned 
5 5 easy to use easy for baby to grasp handy for teething and for dangling toys from play gyms etc 
5 5 excellent product sticks easier than any others i ve tried 
4 3 purchased this product 20 months ago for my 3rd child and am just now writing a review because i wanted to see how it held up i still use it everyday for my 19 month old it is very sturdy and convenient i rated it 3 stars because when it first arrived i checked the material that holds up up the poles for the different stages and it was coming apart i wanted to send it back but didn t have time to find something else i sewed it to reinforce myself so far that has worked fine i also wish they sold replacement padding because things happen and it is empossible to find something else the same size if it needs to be replaced
5 5 this bin is adorable and heavy duty its not hard sided and will fold in if you lean on it holds a lot of toys 
1 1 the brush unscrews just above the handle it stores a small air vent brush inside and after about a week of using it the brush would come apart at the screw every time i used it i wasn t unscrewing it to get the air vent brush since i have one out already it s just a week point in the design couldn t use it anymore after a week unless i just used the top brush part without the blue handle section very disappointing had similar issue with the regular not deluxe dr brown s brush which rusted and broke in half just below the top brush section after only a couple weeks got a munchkin brush and it works great 
5 5 we re very happy with this cup my 8 month old dislikes all bottles and barely drinks from other sippy cups but she drinks pretty well from this easy to clean and very cute 
1 1 didn t work at all
5 5 bought this as a gift but have used chicco for my daughter and will for son super easy to use and love the safety stats on these as well 
5 1 these bags make it obvious why the lansinoh bags are so popular cons the medela bags are nearly impossible to get zip closed and i can never seem to do it without getting milk on the top and air inside the bag they are also horrible for measurement what looks like 5oz on the bag is actually around 4oz if you measure with a medela bottle i m not sure how to get the bag to stand up with milk in it and hit the 5oz mark correctly the idea of pumping directly into a bag is fantastic but i exclusively pump and routinely get 4 5oz from one side which makes pumping precarious because these bags are nearly full with that amount the medela bags do not freeze flat they are thicker at one end which makes these bags a space hog in my freezer i m only using these medela bags until my new box of lansinoh bags arrives in a couple of days 
1 1 not real item shipping is too slow
1 1 terrible leaks like crazy only buy if your child never turns over their cup 
5 5 there is nothing better than looking back and seeing your little one safe and sound rear facing is ideal for longer than most are aware often times babies are turned around sooner than they should be because moms and dads are trying to keep an eye on them or can t see them or their kiddo wants to see them for their safety it s best to keep them rear facing as long as possible and having a quality baby mirror makes that a bit easier to do they made a mirror that has a clear view and lets you see your precious baby in their safe rear facing car seat the view is so clear that your baby will not have a difficult time seeing you as well this baby mirror was super easy to install and can be used with almost every vehicle as far as i can tell the design provides for a large visible space it is not heavy or bulky i love affordable quality baby items if you don t have a little one you might consider buying one of these for someone you know who will be having a little one soon or has one i think the design is actually really cute and the soft rounded edges seem more appealing to me i received a free product for a review my opinions are 100 honest and my own 
1 1 the quality is not good i don t think it will be safe for my girl will return it 
5 5 i am so very impressed my order was fulfilled through amazon and they goofed with one of the 4 items i contacted the seller and they went above and beyond what i would have expected to fix the issue because of this amazing service and beautiful quality i will find a reason to shop this seller as often as possible i m thankful i found her good prices and quality items 
1 1 these nipples leaked pretty badly 
5 5 wonderful product 
5 5 love these bibs soft cute sayings and do a great job 
5 5 this is in my son s room and he loves it we have it hanging lower so that he can reach it and put his animals in and out by himself it is a good quality and is lasting us for a long time it is great for keeping stuffed animals off of the floor 
5 4 convienant i use it almost everyday 
5 5 i recently ordered 34 yourecofamily 34 fitted crib sheet in beige i must say i am very pleased with this purchase i love the fact that it is 100 organic cotton free from any chemicals as i feel this is better for an infant especially one that may have allergies or breathing problems or sensitive skin organic has become highly recommended for children as well as adults the size 28 34 x 52 34 x 9 34 fits a standard crib mattress perfectly and has a really nice feel to it i hope that they will come out with some different colors but for now the beige will work just fine in fact it would be perfect as a shower gift to be used for 34 unisex 34 gift also available is the flat sheet pillowcases and crib skirt also 34 organic 34 the sheet comes packaged in a gift style box ready to give i look forward to ordering more as needed this was an excellent 34 amazon 34 purchase and as always i am never disappointed i did however receive this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest unbiased review the price however does not affect my opinion of this product you will love them :)

5 5 none available

5 5 perfect for taking around town and everywhere we go while potty training well my daughter is a champ what can i say but this has been helpful keeping her on track

5 5 bought for a friend and she loves this product
5 5 works like it should 
5 5 pushes easy much upgrades since older models fits key fit 30 chicco padded seats better buckles 3 year old loves it great product swivel wheel is a must spend the extra folds good to fit in van 
5 3 good cleaning cloths
5 5 just used the go glass bottle for the first time and love it more importantly my one month old loves it super cute as well easy to clean definitely recommend 
5 3 had a small stain
4 4 smaller than i thought but the kids don t care they still love it 
3 3 i bought hits basket to store magazines and newspapers it looks very nice in our living room i really like the espresso color which blends in perfectly the size however doesn t work well for me it s much smaller at the base compared to the top and this reduces storage capacity i also feel the quality for the price is just okay could have been better overall the color and style of this basket goes very well in our living room otherwise i probably would have returned it for a better quality product for that price 
5 5 loved them
5 5 girlfriend loved it 
5 5 i love wubbanubs 34 giraffee 34 is one of my daughters favorite ones wubbanub s are perfect for babies once they can grab the animal makes it so easy for the baby to find and stick back in their own mouth due to its size this is nice because when they wake up in the middle of the night they can grab it and reassert it helps the baby to soothe themselves and fall right back to sleep plus they are absolutely adorable now that my daughter is older she loves to babble at her giraffe they also can chew on different parts of the animal noonie i wash my daughters every other day in the washing machine and leave it to air dry super easy to clean 
5 5 our daughter loves her frog so much that we now have two of them this is great because if she wakes up in the middle of the night and wants her pacifier she can easily grab it herself 
5 5 excellent
5 5 my infant loves these they are high quality material and the nipple fit in my daughter s mouth when she was only a few days old she s still using them at 7 weeks and will probably continue until she graduates to the larger size they seem a little pricey but i am willing to pay a higher price for nuk products 
5 5 good product as described arrived on time
5 5 these arrived yesterday and i m so excited our daughter spits her pacifiers out between rooms at night and i find myself frantically searching the dark floor i set them under a lamp for a few minutes and it was still glowing when i went t check on her hours later very happy with this purchase 
5 5 bought one because i heard good things about it my son loves it i ll be buying more in the future 
5 5 these are our favorite pacifiers and i will continue to buy them for my own babies as well as gifts for others 
3 2 the nipple part of the pacifier is fine but didn t seem like anything special the shape of the area around the face makes for a great 34 handle 34 for baby to hold on to and yank the pacifier out my daughter continually pulled out the pacifier and would get really upset so we quit using them 
5 5 all i have to say is wow for both the product and the seller my baby girl loves these and while there was a tiny misunderstanding which wasn t even that big of a deal this seller went above and beyond to make sure i was satisfied thanks 
5 5 these pacifiers are compact orthodontic and my son took to them instantly i also love the carrying case that can be used to sterilize the pacifiers in the microwave i wish they glowed a little more brightly and for a longer time they lose their glow after thirty minutes or so but it s not a huge issue 
5 4 hey these work great and are super easy to attach to a pacifier clip but they don t even kind of glow in the dark 
5 5 the best
5 5 the only binky we ve been able to get the little one to take 
5 5 came fast item just as described 
5 2 out of all the natural pacifiers out there this is my least favorite even when brand new the nipple would stick to the ring and my daughter 7 months would get frustrated because then she couldn t suck on the pacifier it also seems stickier in general than the other brands right out of he box it s fine to use if i m lying right beside her and can unstick the nipple from the outer ring but is a definite no go for bed time unless i want to get up often which who in their right mind does we have found much better success with the eco piggy it seems so much more high quality 
5 5 our grandson started on this binkie while still in the nicu the monkey s weight keeps it pretty much in place and because of its size it hasn t been misplaced or lost 
5 5 we have tried several other brands of natural pacifiers and this one is our favorite it seems to be of the highest quality smell the least weird though they all smell weird when brand new and have the best shape in fact this is the only one i have bought more than one of and i will continue to do so as needed stay away from natursutten the nipple sticks to the outer ring making baby really frustrated when they go to put the paci in their mouth 
1 2 acceptable when crib is up but now that the crib is on the lowest level they re useless totally collapse and look sloppy disappointed 
5 4 super cute great for grabbing wipes as you walk out the door after a week or so the wipes do dry out but this case is much easier to throw in a diaper bag than a box of wipes and it s so adorable
5 5 hilarious who doesn t love a baby with a mustache 
5 5 this toy has been so much fun this summer have brought it to the pool many times and had a blast bath time has gotten messy but fun my son is 15 months old and cannot fill it with water but has no problem pushing it out if i hold the squid 
5 5 this is amazing and has all the right pockets to fit all the junk my kids leave in the back of the car i am so pleased i m getting another one for the other side 
5 5 my 9 month old loves this she loves it so much that she will hold still for me while i change her diaper if she s holding it it basically doubles as a teether the design prevents choking what a great product 
1 2 i think these deserve a bad review because they most certainly don t stop anybody from flinging their food around the suction is pretty much non existent if these were marketed as plain ole toddler bowls then they would get a four star review from me but that s not why i bought them there are plenty of cuter better options for plain toddler bowls and so these sit mostly unused but they do make good bath toys ;)
5 5 bought this because of the great reviews about it and they re all true i have really sensitive scalp so i m very prone to dandruff it s a little hard because i switch from shampoo to shampoo but i ve never found the right one until this it really is gentle and its smell is not anything too grand just light and simple i like that because it means there s less irritants in it i ve been using this for almost a week now and it s just great i don t have dandruff anymore and it never makes me itch 
5 5 i am extremely happy with the hippo organizer it is the third organizer i am buying and finely this one is just perfect my son loves it too 
5 2 these stage 2 nipples are different than the stage 2 nipples i have at home the hole isn t as large so it s a lit harder for my baby to get the milk out 
4 4 this is a very high quality bag strong stitching however it isn t as deep and big as it appears even though the measurements are presented it is still a surprise to see the actual size in the promo pic things are sticking out of the pockets which is an actual depiction because if you try to put a water bottle in it pack of wipes or diapers they are going to protrude the actual depth of the carrier is smaller than the length of my hand see pictures the back zippered pocket can hold some small items i e keys but it isn t useful for items of any size the promo picture also shows a phone held in the front pocket however i wouldn t count on that being a use for it i own a sony phone with a non slip cover total width is 3 1 2 34 it wouldn t fit in this pocket the velcro that holds this in place is strong so that s a plus but i didn t test this with a lot of heavy items in place i e will it hold up with a full complement of heavy items such as a water bottle sunscreen baby wipes diapers keys etc like i said the velcro is a decent size and gripped well so it s possible i liked also that this can be used as a carry all for other things not just on a stroller for example it can be used as a 34 fanny pack 34 for a bicycle want to carry some power up bars water bottle first aid items on a mountain biking trip this could come in handy for that i m not sure that a guy would want to use this with the giant 34 maternity 34 logo in pink on the front though if it weren t there it could be great for men or women to use in whatever capacity it was needed overall it is a nice organizer 
5 5 these are perfect for messy eaters as well as arts and crafts
5 5 it might seem silly to spend money on baby spoons but these are absolutely worth it they are easy to use easy to clean colorful and safe furthermore there customer service is absolutely top notch with prompt email responses and follow through best spoons with best service whats not to like 
1 1 i want to remove the sticky mark on the yellow one when i want to use it for kids it s broken immediately i use the blue one the snap cannot be locked the quality is very poor waste money to buy 
5 4 everyone loved them used this for a bridal shower though you need a lot of patience and or help to put these together 
5 5 huge bag it can fit several large beach towels and the pockets are gigantic i bought this as a diaper bag but it is a little large for that purpose nonetheless it is my go to family bag where i can stick my purse or the diaper bag in it and some towels or snacks and water bottles it stands up on its own which is a plus the fabric is durable and the side mesh pockets are super there is a zipper on top i would recommend this bag to anyone needing a family bag for all the essentials 
5 5 my 3yo loves this towel it is holding up well 
5 3 my son is a master at getting out of a traditional swaddle swaddling as me and my husband found out is the only way he will stay asleep so we were pretty much at wits end when we would swaddle him with a blanket and he would find his way out in a half an hour cool in comes the swaddle me it is high quality and doesn t feel cheap i like the fact it has velcro to help secure the swaddle however my son will still from time to time manage to work his hands down towards the bottom and out of the swaddle and then he proceeds to crying because his hands are free i m not sure what they should do about that maybe make a velco part to secure the bottom where they can work their hands free until then this is good enough to use for now until he is 1 able to sleep without being swaddled or 2 we find something better 
5 5 love this super durable my 5yo son thrashes everything and easy to wipe clean going to buy another one for the in laws house 
5 5 fantastic coverage of granddaughters eyes i brought them into my shop to test them licensed optician and they pass uv and light transfer buying for my other granddaughter and my nephew 
5 5 works great
5 5 great product fast shipping its perfect for use at home
5 5 i love how many toys this net holds we probably have 40 stuffed animals hanging in this net easy and quick to install 
3 2 trees were smaller than i thought but made them work 
5 5 made diaper changes a breeze amazing product 
5 5 great 
5 4 good
5 5 we love these binkies they glow in the dark which is great i would note that they won t keep their glow all night long but they do for most of the night we keep a few of these in a bowl on the dresser so that i can just grab another one if the first one is 34 lost 34 in the bed at night i would recommend this product 
5 5 my son 3 mos old loves these and everyone gets a kick out of seeing him with them in his mouth they re a hoot just as durable as any other pacifier we use 
5 5 my son loves these i had gotten the i love daddy ones at the store and was so excited to see the had the i love mommy ones too now we secretly slip one or the other in his mouth as a friendly competition 
5 5 i have use these with 2 of my 4 children and am pregnant now due today actually and plan to use these again coming from a breastfeeding mom i personally am not too concerned with if it is 34 orthodontic 34 or not i know that sounds bad but this is why nipple confusion these closely resemble mom s and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped i don t let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the 34 orthodontic 34 aspect doesn t really apply even if you re formula feeding most of the bottles like avent gerber or even medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same in the other reviews i read i saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit here s a solution i haven t found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for soothies they have some by booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base i personally dont care for these the way they suggest to use them the loop rubs against baby s face and sits right where their mouth is wet just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen so my solution i used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a booginhead through that im sure you could use anything to put the hold there if you do this make sure its a small hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking there are also some by bella tunno or ulububu that clips on the tab these don t hold too well but i guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap dpersonally i think soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves problem solved so long and short of it i think these are the best :D:)
5 2 they are cute but there aren t enough air holes my baby gets rashes from these when used too long 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my daughter will take and we tried seven different kinds the nipple on this pacifier seems to be a little shorter smaller than other pacifiers which i think is part of the reason she prefers it it seems very sturdy and is made in the usa which i really appreciate if you have tried other pacifiers and your child won t take them it is worth giving jollypop a try important to note i cannot find this in any stores near me so online ordering may be your only option 
5 5 bought this to go with infant tux for a wedding little guy was a real hit took lots of pictures to remember 
5 4 grandson likes them
5 5 can t say enough good things about the wubbanub wish it had a clasp to attach to clothing
5 3 our daughter does not seem to like these mam pacifiers as much as she seems to like the unisex mam newborn ones with the clear nipple can t say why as she can t tell me she s 3 weeks old but she very frequently spits these out or won t take them at all but is always receptive to and soothed by the clear bunny heart combo ones cute colors and images though 
5 3 the same designe i choose not recive the one what i got is deffrinet 
5 5 most pacifiers gave my newborn a rash these worked great with no rash 
5 5 baby loved them they don t cause rashes best part easy to find at night without turning on the light 
5 3 it s a bit of an inconvenient game because you have to cut every single pacifier out also it just killed my ocd that the poster itself and many of the pacifiers are creased because the game comes folded in a package if you ve spent so much time making the decor for your party pretty the creased game will detract from that having said that my guests really did enjoy playing this game you might be better off making your own prettier version of this game 
5 5 this cute lil puppy paci has prompted so many adorable pictures i bought this after having to put paci s back in baby s mouth when they fell out way too many times in a row i thought this would be a better alternative because the puppy could sit on her chest while the paci is in her mouth it does exactly that granted it s not heavy so it can be knocked off but i wouldn t want it to be heavy love it ;)
5 5 the only paci my little one is willing to accept 
5 5 love the glowing part in the night very useful in order not to wake up my little guy 
1 1 i could only use one of them because the other one had a hole in the tip which just caused my baby to suck in air i noticed another buyer had this same issue not impressed 
5 5 thank you i received it today really cute 
5 4 my baby really likes these pacifiers and the handle makes them easy to hold onto or attach to his clothes or ours if we are wearing him the designs don t last beyond several washings though and they don t glow in the dark i m especially disappointed that feature doesn t work better because i ws excited to have some help when feeling around for a dropped paci in the dark while trying to soothe the baby back to sleep 
5 5 these are a little pricey the gave one to my son while he was in the nicu at ucsf and he loved it it was easier to stay in his mouth he doesn t really use a binky now but still plays with it and its a fun thing to have around 
5 5 works for my newborn
5 5 we have several of these my month old loves them and so do i because they re easy for him to find and put in his mouth 
5 5 these pacifiers are gorgeous i know that sounds silly but they really are they are sparkly which is fantastic for anyones little princess i thought these were really cute in the picture but they are even better in person these are by far my favorite pacifiers just for the pictures on them alone all of the pacifiers we have in our house for our kiddos are mam we have tried many other pacifiers and none compare as far as quality cuteness and the fact that my kids preferred them 
5 5 most parents know that not all babies will use just any pacifier my 9 month old has consistently preferred avent pacifiers since he was a newborn we switched to the next biggest size at 8 months and it took a little while for him to get used to it he uses both the smaller and the bigger sizes now i love the designs and different colors although i don t believe you can specify colors when you order through amazon 
5 3 fun game
5 5 we love mam in this house i ve used them exclusively with 3 kids now best out there 
5 5 we love mam 
5 2 very cute bit tiny 
5 5 love it it s soft and easy for baby to hold on to
5 5 baby loves it 
5 5  
5 5 these are the best pacifiers for nighttime pacifier replacement glows all night after some exposure to light of course your baby has to like the mam style but that s simply an issue of preference 
3 3 don t like that you can t take the pacifier off and sterilize it but other than this okay my daughter didn t care for it
5 4 the only pacifier that my baby will use
5 4 tommee tippee pacifiers are the only ones my baby will use i just wish you could choose the colors 
5 5 so cute
5 2 my baby didn t like those she likes the mam pacifiers instead 
5 5 our baby boy loves these it s the same ones as the ones they provide in the hospitals he doesn t like any other kind it probably is because it s the most similar to a mothers breast not sure why it is bpa free 
5 5 these were too big for my baby s mouth at first but by 3 months it is his pacifier of choice my baby is breast fed and does not usually take a pacifier but at night he will or if he needs soothing in the car and this one does the trick 
5 5 i bought 4 kinds of pacifiers this is the only one that stays in my 2 month old baby boy s mouth he loves it i m throwing all the other ones out they just don t work for him 
5 5 love it
5 5 this is my second one my son loves them the monkey lays flat on his tummy which is why i like it will be buying another soon 
5 5 for my granddaughter she has been raised on avent pacifiers and bottles her mother swears by this product 
1 1 um you can see inside the babies mouth also the baby is expecting food as it is the same shape as a regular bottle nipple babies mouth is wide open when sucking on this i m not saying i m just saying its weird and the baby didn t like it go to walmart and get any of the other 100 kinds same s t
5 5 i really like this particular brand of pacifiers they are my son s favorite this brand has pacifiers 0 3 0 6 and 6 but i did not know that initially and got a few packs of 0 3 as we lose them constantly now i would just get 0 6 and later 6 
5 5 super cute very soft and perfect size 
5 5 a welcome invention i m taking care of my new baby granddaughter and loving every minute didn t have these when raising my children and always looking for the pacifier wonderful
5 5 love it when my son walks around the house with this binkie in his mouth :)
5 5 the only bunny my daughter would take 
5 5 these work well for my son i don t think the shape is orthodontically approved but really would any pacifier be when you think about it we like it and i m sure we will be reading every internet blog about how to get rid of these things any day now 
3 5 the smell is okay the color is deep green which is good but the taste os horrible 
5 5 our little one really likes both the bottles and the pacifiers in this set plus the easy bottle sterilization system is fantastic 
5 5 we cannot live without this for our 11 month old it was perfect when he was younger and had trouble grasping small objects sometimes he doesn t even use the paci part of it the monkey acts as enough of a 34 security blanket 34 for him when he was smaller we also propped this up on his chest into his mouth when he is in his crib so it less likely to fall and roll away 
1 2 doesn t stay put at all in my 2 month old baby boy s mouth only the anatomically shaped nuk pacifiers work for us 
5 5 you can t find these in the retail stores these are a life saver 
5 5 great pacifiers it s really nice that it s one piece and easy to disinfect and keep clean 
5 5 i attached this to my baby s mobile above his crib when i was sleep training and he never cried longer than 5 minutes he wakes up finds his binky and goes back to bed it s changed my life my baby is 6 months old i did have it attached to his carseat for about a week or two so he learned how to use it before i used it in his crib 
5 5 the case they come in acts as a sanitizer which is a nice addition you just fill with water to the level and microwave for 3 min they are very sturdy and love the color design for a baby boy if you have an infant 62 6 months i would strongly recommend checking this out 
4 4 temp reads a little lower than it should and it takes around 5 minutes to get the temp it works just fine and does its purpose but it s a bit slow 
3 3 it s cute but not heavy enough my newborn can easily push it out of her mouth
5 5 so cute love it
5 4 my son will only use this pacifier 
5 5 loved this and loved that we had a game for the 34 little 34 girls to play at our baby shower
5 4 these are the only ones my son will use tough material even when my puppies grab them 
1 1 snaps broke first time i used it would not recommend 
5 5 greats 34 binks 34 great price these are the only brand my baby will use 
5 5 great set my son has colic and these seem to do the trick very happy 
5 5 special wub for a special granddaughter :)
5 5 just like the one from the hospital great price one in each room of the house
5 5 love wubbanubs best pacifier for newborn babies as the animal holds the pacifier close to their mouth even when it pops out often my 6 week old can put it back in his own mouth when it pops out or i can grab it quickly since it stays against his chest we have tried other pacifiers but he won t take any of them except this kind so now we own five of them to clean them i just throw them in the washing machine with the baby clothes and they come out in good shape every time 
5 5 we have had several of the wubbanub pacifiers over the last few years and i believe this one pink bear is the softest the wubbanub are great and very well loved even when outgrown as a pacifier it has remained a very important stuffed animal during bedtime 
5 5 harder to lose harder to drop easier to cuddle easier to love 
4 5 wish it could be bigger but still good product
1 2 baby did not like it also the wrong color was sent to us
5 5 these were the only pacifiers that our newborn took to when we introduced at 3 weeks they are a little large but it doesn t seem to bother her and the shape keeps it from hitting her little nose she wanted nothing to do with the soothies for the price i definitely recommend trying these out every kid is different of course but we couldn t be happier with these 
4 2 i wish the animal would come off and attach to another paci my lo likes the puppy but chokes on the paci every time 
5 5 arrived quick and just as described would def buy again :)
5 4 these are perfect no issues that i can see 
5 5 not only is this adorable it makes loosing a paci so much easier to find 
5 5 good price
5 5 great baby shower present 
5 5 my baby loves these she will not tolerate the other types of pacifiers she only likes these super suit is i think it s because they more so mimic the shape of an actual nipple they are great because they are actually cheaper than the other types of pacifiers as well use with a universal pacifier clip and you are good to go 
5 5 soo in luv with these we just received the blue okey dokey dino and the red dragon we also have the monkey and giraffe they are perfect for comforting and binky doesn t get lost oh and free shipping was super fast ordered on the 18th received on the 21st we were supposed to get them between 24 27 28 
5 3 our baby loves this pacifier we had one as a gift from his aunt and we tought about buying another one this one looked as good as the first one but the quality was not that good still a good product but do not expect it to be forever
5 5 great
5 5 huge wubanub fans 
5 5 products came quick and with no damage 
5 5 my baby loves these they don t slip out easily
5 5 excelent choice 
3 3 high quality but my son did not like it 
5 5 my older daughter loved these pacifiers this one doesn t care much for them but when i used them they were great 
5 5 whoever thought of glow in the dark pacifiers is a genius these are wonderful if my son loses it in the night he can find it himself and go right back to sleep 
5 5 both of my daughters love mam pacis and they are cute 
5 5 cool
5 5 we have and will always use the soothies our babies have all loved them great item at an excellent price thank you 
5 5 these are the best ones my lo had mam and avent spacifiers she liked them for a while then she never wants them again i bought dr brown pacifiers it took a day or more for my baby to get used with these and then she loves it its very easy and good for her
5 4 my son did not like these pacifiers but they are food quality 
5 5 only pacifiers my son will use 
5 3 cute and soft but my grandson who is 5 months old just yanks it out of his mouth instead of keeping it in which was what the purpose of getting it for him 
5 5 gave this as a shower gift it was a hit with everyone 
5 5 my daughter loves her wubbanub she won t take any other pacifier she will take the plain soothie pacifier on occasion but usually spits it out if i hand her her wubbanub it calms her down most of the time she loves holding onto it the plush toy is so easy to wash too so no big deal if it gets dirty i have washed it several times now and it has held up perfectly i am very happy with my purchase i am buying more of these in different plush animals to have for her 
5 5 very good quarity price is very satisfaction
5 5 we love it
5 5 i wish i could ve picked the design 
4 4 it does the job
5 4 these were great unfortunately my daughter didn t accept any kind of pacifier but these were cute and came in a nice carrying case 
5 2 i wanted baseball like pictured but got football
5 5 best invention ever 
4 4 the only reason it doesn t get 5 s is because it suddenly will fall off fortunately it s fallen off when i ve not been in the shower if i were holding it it lost its grip that could be dangerous but so far it hasn t fallen off has a good grip it s done well for me 
5 5 i love these because really wubbanubs and sophie the giraffe are waaaay to pricey to replace frequently we haven t lost a nice toy yet in almost two years thanks to these 
5 5 our one year old son loves it 
5 5 best sippy cup we ve tried and we have tried a lot 
5 5 sooo cute nice and sold
5 5 awesome look 
5 5 very good
5 5 my son has really enjoyed this people say they like the necklace and are usually very surprised to find that it s also a teething toy we ve been using it for a few months now and it has no signs of wear 
5 5 so cute but ran slightly large 
5 3 designs are cute but the velcro doesn t hold up with frequent use even with hand washing only 
5 5 i looked all over in stores for a pillow the right size for my son s bed but couldn t find one anywhere so i turned to amazon and am so happy with the little sleepy head toddler pillow i ordered it is sized just right for a toddler bed i teach preschool and i intend to recommend this product to the parents of my students for use during naptime i agree with other reviewers assessments of the customer service i had no issue with my product but received an email asking if i was completely satisfied that was a first for me 
5 3 i m glad that these gave our bottles a second life but i wish they were hard my daughter likes to dump her bottle upside down and press the sippy spout into the couch releasing water everywhere 
5 5 works great 
4 3 i like that this is cute an convenient the one downside is that the blanket gets rough and nubby after only a few washes i wish it was removable 
5 5 it is good
5 5 huge bubble guppies fan looooves this blanket as others have said very soft and lightweight great blanket 
5 5 this product comes shipped in this adorable packaging which would look great in a baby themed basket the blanket is very light weight and soft perfect solution to use in warmer weather this blanket would be appropriate to drape over an infant carrier or stroller to shield a sleeping baby also because its cotton weave is bigger and breathable this would work well as a cover while breast feeding the colors are gender neutral off white background charcoal grey lambs with tan noses lambs are good for baby boys or baby girls so this is a great gift for the parents that are waiting 34 to be surprised 34 i like that the size is nearly 4 feet square i have not washed this product yet so i don t know how if any shrinkage will occur the packaging does not state it s been prewashed so i would expect it may get smaller this blanket is an organic product made in the usa that s another plus i received this product at a discount in exchange for my review that does not mean that i give all products five stars as an online shopper i rely heavily on opinions of others when making my purchasing decisions products with false reviews only cause disappointment when received by the consumer if i don t like a product it will show in my review 
5 4 baby is not here yet so i can t speak for how they work all reviews on every website say great but they are soo very soft and easy to use can t wait to see my little dude in them and feel glorious about helping save our planet as well as provide better care for wee ones skin and booty not to mention what i spent on my entire collection disposable diaper users spend in 2 months 
5 5 i love this diaper pail it s simple and affordable and the bag refills are also very affordable i never intended to buy a diaper pail even after all the hype over diaper genies and what not because the cost was always so expensive and for something you just throw poppy diapers in i wasn t going to spend a small fortune with my second child though the garbage can in my bedroom started to smell so bad i considered a diaper genie as i was researching though a lot of great reviews came up for this diaper pail and the price is unbeatable i bought it and i am very glad i did it holds a good amount of diapers is easy to change and completely blocks out any odors i 100 recommend this pail 
5 5 my son loves it i bought this tooth brush just as his first tooth popped through he now brushes his tooth with toothpaste every morning and night with mommy makes for a easy task for my 7 month old while i brush my teeth 
4 4 if the beads would stay together my son would of loved this but he ended up on one bead then string because he was too little to keep it in his mouth without dropping it or wrapping his hand around the necklace but an older baby may do better i love the different shapes for his choosing and it s easy to clean
5 5 my lil mermaid just loved a more 34 tween 34 style bedroom makeover the instructions and quality of this wall decor was an awesome find i can t wait to try another decal on my other granddaughter s room 
3 3 my baby wouldn t take these but i like the style and them seem good 
5 5 love them 
5 5 my infant twins love these they love snuggling with the stuffed animal and i don t have to worry about them getting lost so easily 
5 5 these are amazing they really do smell like vanilla and the scent lasts for a long time our daughter uses them at bed time and i feel that she sleeps better thanks to the soothing vanilla scent we ll be ordering more of these soon a must have for every mommy that plans on putting baby down with a binky 
5 3 my daughter hated it i was happy with the construction and tried multiple times to give it to her the rubber around the nip was too large i even got the one with the scoop at the top so it wouldn t hit her nose but it still did 
1 2 i should have done a bit more research into this before i purchased it they are really hard i will not be getting 3 months again but stick with the 0 3 my baby spits these out the minute he tries to suck them 
5 5 this review is based off one day s use i got my sterilizer and dryer and immediately opened it i previously washed about twenty bottles and put them in the sterilizer to use it right away after four cycles of sterilizing and drying i m obsessed i can t believe it how easy it works and how well it dries there s nothing i dislike more than leaving wet bottles for days to dry on my counter i hope this keeps working well as time goes on 
1 2 the nipple is too short even for a 2 month old i got 0 to 6 months size disappointed that i spent so much for something she will not keep in her mouth 
5 5 my little man loves this pacifier this is the only brand he will use the large vent holes on the sides are great for him to get air but he also loves to stick his tongue out of the sides 
5 5 this pacifier has been great to use with my grandaughter since her mom is breastfeeding she had trouble breastfeeding after using other pacifiers this one is our favorite especially since we are a cat family she likes to hold onto one ear so sweet 
5 5 good product
5 4 my son is used to the advent pacifiers and this one was too different so he didn t even wear it it has a flat part like nuke bottle nipples have didn t have any other problems with it though 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my son will actually take he loves them they re the perfect sizes for infants 
5 5 can t wait to use jt
5 5 i really like this because i can fit two paci s and i attached it to my diaper bag for easy access 
5 5 the glow in the dark feature is amazing if you want it to glow bright for most of the night hold it right up to a bright light bulb desk lamp or mirror lights in a bathroom work very well for about 20 seconds the pacing will be so bright there is no chance of losing it my son loves the fit of these pacifiers 
5 5 my baby loves these 
5 5 our 7 month old loves it super cute colors and really well made 
5 1 i have ordered for babies 6 12 month old but actually got 0 6 
5 4 our son likes these the best since he was a newborn so we just got a bigger size he is able to find his binky himself now and put it back into his mouth we like the extra air to help avoid any rashes the only issue was putting a daycare label on these lol not a product fault though 
5 5 our favorite brand of pacifier hands down we have tried avent nuk and various mustachifiers 
5 5 bought the wubbanub for our new baby grandson turns out he took right to it and loves it what a find 
5 5 super cheap for two pacifiers and it was the exact type that the hospital gave us so we have back up if we were to lose it 
5 5 love this item clears space in my diaper bag for other things and the prints are super cute 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my baby will take thank you green hospital pacifier i am just grateful that the soothie comes in more colors now the pink and purple ones are great and very girly i m a fan of anything that lets strangers see that my baby is a girl :)
5 5 awesome item
5 5 very cute my baby is in love with it won t go to sleep with out it 
5 5 great product thank you 
5 5 my son just loves wubbanub with they had a fox though wink wink 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my nephew will use and they are perfect highly recommended 
5 5 very cute got this as a gift and the momma loved it 
5 5 loooove these pacifiers my baby girl tried so many pacifiers and these were the only ones she liked and would take
5 5 great product thank you 
5 5 fun surprise 
5 4 my son loves this pacifier he has a very easy gag reflex and this tip is short and his is able to use without gagging 
5 5 my baby loves these bottles i do too i love the design easy to clean the mam gift sets are always cheaper this is my 3rd set i wanted the monkey set but got the otters set that s my only complaint 
5 5 love this and so does my baby the elephant is super cute and easy for my baby to hold on to highly recommend 
5 3 if your baby isn t used to the hospital style nuk paci binki then its not as cool as it seems really do wish they had these with different options for the nuk at the end i may just sew one of ours to it super awesome concept just needs more options to taylor to different babies :)
5 5 best pacifier my 11 month old has not been able to bite through it and he has 6 teeth 
5 5 love it and everyone always comments on it 
5 3 these things deffinatly come in handy the only thing is they leave an awful taste 
5 5 safe and my grandson loves it 
5 5 this review is really on behalf of my babies because we have tried different ones but both would only use soothie pacifiers 
5 5 only ones my son will use
5 4 the only pacifier my baby will take but they don t glow in the dark as much as i thought they would 
5 5 these are the only binky my newborn will take and work like a charm 
5 5 we have had this now for several months we love it it has not had to be repositioned and it has stayed firm very good product for keeping our balance 
5 5 it was a gift snd they liked it a lot
5 3 good
5 3 well some what ok
5 5 so cute and easy for mytoddler to hold onto
5 5 it s just what i wanted for naps on the couch perfect delivery 
5 4 our baby loves this and i like that the animals rotate so there s always a smiling face to look at the music selection is great but as others have stated i wish the volume could be turned down a little lower than the lowest setting available we haven t had to replace the batteries yet and we ve used it daily for 2 months so far 
5 4 works great i do recommend it 
5 4 works well 
2 2 in 2011 we purchased this cradle we used it with our daughter post nicu from one month after she was released until 3 months from 3 5 months it was used occasionally but being a 10lb baby she didn t have much growing room at the three month point i had my gallbladder removed and it was too difficult to get her out of this at night post surgery so we began co sleeping we didn t get to use it how we imagined but we kept it in case we had another child so for the next three years it was properly stored in 2015 we had our next child 9lbs at birth he was smaller so he fit more easily in the cradle he used it a decent amount in his first three months and slowly tapered off as the four month sleep regression kicked in then we went to roll it from beside our bed and crack one foot bend in under the cradle so now we have to take this thing apart and junk it because it broke we barely got a total of 6 months between two babies and it broke seriously now we are using a co sleeper in its place which is what i would recommend or just a small second crib like the sniglar from ikea something even a gulliver from ikea would be better financially i m disappointed that for 160 we got 6 months of use maybe 
5 1 this is just a hair trimmer it shaves hair off but i cannot imagine it is permanently removed 
5 5 wife is very happy and so am i for the price
5 3 not worth the price i ordered silly tails there is no story to it just describes the tail ie shiny tail others have mentioned these books have a battery this one does not so it does not make sounds other than crinkling i was hoping the tails could be removed and matched or rearranged so i am a bit disappointed with my purchase 
5 5 super cute little art pieces even though our nursery is a green blue and brown color scheme these canvas art pieces still fit in really nicely the colors aren t too bold and the cuteness of dogs on planes catches your attention without loud colors being thrown at you and ruining the color scheme they are not too small but not too large so they were easy to affix onto the walls without drilling we used some hooks fixed with wall tape and they secured great this is probably my boyfriend s favorite nursery item that i have bought i received these canvas art pieces at a discount for testing purposes 
5 5 the only sippy cups we use 
5 5 very pretty
5 5 looks great it s 15 34 x 11 34 works great easy to use it needs distilled boiled water but i just do a kettle and fill up a wine bottle and use that a week or two i wash the items and place it on the rack and when it fills up i turn it on it has a few options it has the i need it now 10 15 min the 45 min w dry and the 60 min like new w dry i use it for tons of stuff from baby toys to feeding supplies to straws jar lids pump supplies anything i can put in here that my kid puts in her mouth that is plastic or glass but in reality it s just a lazy tool i don t have time to boil stuff on the regular and i don t use microwaves it s a rich mans accessory but it s real nice if you can justify it i suggest it 
4 1 to small hard to fit 1 inc folder needs to big just a little bit bigger to fit the basic school supplies 
5 5 product arrived promptly and i am totally satisfied with my purchase the carter s shopping cart baby cover is well made and the storage space holds small items to keep little fingers busy 
5 5 baby loves this it s very soft luckily i received a boy color i recommend this item for gift giving i plan to order more for new baby gifts 
1 1 bought it when baby was 6 months old didn t like it then and doesn t like it now when she is 9 months the chair just does not seem comfortable ended up buying bumbo 
5 5 easy way to avoid processed baby foods and prepare your own after steaming 
5 5 very useful for having baby in the car easier for me to check up on the back seat
5 5 cute little toys my grandson used to watch them after we would wind them great entertainment for infants thank you
5 5 very good
1 1 i can t say anything about the content because i didn t get to look through these books or read them with my toddler i took them out of the packaging and got a nasty cut from the sharp edges of the pages i ll be returning them 
4 4 this was delivered on time too soft and fits the mattress well i give it four stars because i don t like the color 
5 5 works wonderfully
5 5 i got this back of bandana bibs for my then 6 month baby boy basically because he is a drooling machine and i was going thru 3 to 4 bibs a day but i was not really happy with the quality and look of the regular bibs i was using the bibs came securely packed and included a coupon to use in a next purchase once i opened them i loved how vibrant the colors were and also how soft they were i also liked a lot that they had two snap options so my baby could grow into them he is 11 month and still uses them i have to say that the quality of this product is great i have wash them countless times and the colors and fabric still look the same highly recommended
2 2 not the best design it s bulky under the mattress wouldn t buy again 
4 3 nice contemporary look to this high chair but a but difficult to move around i have tile so not sure if that s the problem 
1 1 it falls off after a few minutes despite excellent cleaning of the underneath surface don t put any weight on it because you ll fall over and injure yourself don t waste your money on it 
5 4 i received this item quickly and hassle free which is always a plus for me fortunately these pacifiers do not look like the picture and they are actually a nicer blue however they do have the holes around the edges so that will most likely be the one you will receive seller please update the picture we are very happy with them and hope our new nephew will like them too 
5 5 my niece really liked this one 
5 5 great pacifier my son only used this brand and not to mention they give personality 
5 5 saw this on shark tank and thought it was a good idea awesome concept 
1 3 doesn t glow long at all 
5 5 the best nubby hands down 
5 5 the only pacis to buy love how they fit against the face this is an advantage to when your baby starts sleeping on their stomach and turning their head from side to side it does not get easily knocked out like other pacifiers do not as bulky as other brands 
5 5 seriously bright glow in the dark so you can find them middle of the night 
5 5 just what i needed 
5 4 well loved and a favorite it finally broke after a solid year and a half of use 
5 3 my baby loved the 0 3 month soothies but she won t take these =(
5 5 so cute 
5 5 so cute
5 5 once our son started jamming the newborn sized mam shield sideways in his mouth and getting it stuck we moved up to the 6 month size these are great and very easy for him to grasp 
5 5 these work great my son didnt have any problems switching back and forth from this one and to the other mam kinds 
5 5 perfect for baby i don t have to worry about him swallowing the soothie 
5 3 i did received a different design so i decided to remove the paci to my boy
4 4 they come with their own little container to sterilize in the microwave which is really handy they are very cute however my baby just won t take them unfortunately not for us but seem to be very good quality 
1 1 out of all the pacifiers i ordered all had holes on the end of nipple so when baby sucked she sucked air 
5 5 i ordered two and they work great they are secure in the shower and don t budge easy to move to a different spot but helpful in keeping a person from falling 
4 3 the strap that holds the piggy back ride was defective obviously not happy about that still in the process in seeing if a replacement can be made other than that the product is great 
1 1 hi everyone i just want to take a moment to say that this monitor is truly a piece of garbage do not buy this monitor i have three children and have owned a few monitors and this one is effectively useless seriously it s a 150 paperweight the signal does not stick and we have a very small house i ve tested it and even when i have it 10 feet away with no obstructions the signal will still go in and out summer should be ashamed of this product parents have way too much going on and we do not want to waste our time and money on junk like this if this review prevents even one person from buying this device my time will have been well spent because i will have saved someone from experiencing the pain of owning this farce of a product 
5 5 my baby got into everything until i found these now they re everywhere cabinets drawers on trash cans and my life is so much easier 
5 5 very nice love it
5 4 it s a super cute little tent but my baby gets upset being zipped up in there and it gets really hot inside he sure has fun tackling and squishing it and maybe when he s older and more secure he ll use it as intended 
5 5 love it this is what i was expecting on time 
5 5 works great harness buckle sits forward more which makes it easier for bigger older children 
5 5 works well 
5 5 this cup is adorable my son loves just holding onto the cup when he plays i received this product in exchange for a review 
5 5 love these no need for dryer sheets i put a drop of lavender essential oil on mine if to make my laundry smell fresher and i really feel it cuts down on drying time 
4 2 worked well to get the potty training started but broke only after 2 weeks
5 4 bought this for my daughter for her first birthday and it was adorable but the elastic in the leg away were too tight left a mark on my daughters leg and i also bought i size up 
5 5 i all around love this haven t used it to warm up baby food just yet but it s warmed up my breast milk perfectly and water i would recommend if you have hard water and develop calcium deposits to put vinegar in the bottom and let it sit then wipe out :)
5 5 this is a must have
5 5 as promised it is for big kids my nephew loves it 
5 5 so very cute 
5 5 to be honest i actually prefer these over the medela ones you really can t beat the price either 
5 5 great affordable changing pad gets the job done
5 5 gets the job done 
5 5 the dena indigo decorative pillow is the perfect accent to the coordinating bedding set i have the bedding set as well which is mixed with different prints and patterns the decorative pillow is mainly pale blue with white in the shape of a little elephant one side of the pillow has a patterned stripe throughout the other side of the pillow has different patterns throughout the decorative pillow resembles the body of an elephant with a trunk ears as well as a tail it measures as indicated 14 5 x 10 5 x 6 inches and is quite lightweight i have one pillow but i think two pillows would make a prettier looking accent to the bedding since each side has a different pattern the ears on the elephant stick out like little flaps on both sides of the pillow and the tail dangles from the back of the elephant there is an eye on each side of the pillow as well as a little mouth right at the base of the trunk the quality of the pillow is wonderful its actually quite comfortable to lay on even though it is a decorative pillow there are no loose strings the stitching is done very well the pillow makes the perfect accent to our nursery we have a baby elephant theme as the nursery decor and it looks perfect with the rest of the bedroom i love this adorable little decorative pillow sitting in the corner of my sons crib its the perfect accent pillow to the dena indigo crib bedding set promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review 
5 5 love these diapers they are great and fit well patterns are perfect for a boy or girl i prefer to use charcoal inserts in stead of the microfiber that comes with these 
5 3 my sister swore up and down about this bouncer her kids loved it and would always sleep in it since i was having babies 20 months apart i figured this would be a safe easy seat for the littlest one wrong i can t turn my back for a second because the first thing my oldest 2 sons realized was when you pushed it down it sprung back up they love to push it to the ground and watch the terror on the baby s face as he springs forward when the baby is not in it i catch them putting their action figures in it to launch them so this might work if you have little girls or only one kid but this has become a very expensive toy launcher in our house 
5 4 good product but very big
2 2 it s just to big it falls off the door handle i thought it would fit around my door nob but it doesn t
5 5 we purchased this crib mattress for a vacation house at home we prefer to use an organic crib mattress but they of course are very expensive this mattress had good reviews and was very reasonably priced it is soft and comfortable and our daughter sleeps well on it for everyday use at home i would recommend buying a more natural mattress without harmful chemicals or plastics but this is a good choice for an extra crib or for someone looking to an inexpensive option 
5 5 love it 
5 5 these are the go to pacifiers for us we had them at the hospital and swear by them i recommend them to everyone i know who is having a baby the only issue we have is if you have pets the material does attract hairs easily but that isn t something a wipe or washing can t fix 
5 5 i used this in the bottom of hit pack n play and all of the sudden my son wi actually sleep in there this works great 
5 5 we love nuk because they seem to be the only style of pacifier that will stay in newborns mouths for more than 5 seconds i also love that they come in multiple sizes to grow with babies who have a hard time dropping the habit as newborns 
5 3 impossible to find if dropped or set down 
5 3 i used the old playtex latex binkies with my daughter several years ago and they had an orthodontic shape like the nuk pacifiers this one does not so i will be switching to the latex nuk ones with that shape 
5 5 this pair was a hit i got them as decorations on a dipper cake for the dad to be huggies and chuggies party the guys thought it was so cool and the new mom to be thinks its just to funny and cute they came in a plastic flip bag together so it was def a good choice to put on the cake i would not want to give it in that bag just not a good presentation 
5 5 super cute fast shipping great price a 
5 5 these pacifiers are great i used them with my son seven years ago and i m using them with my daughter now here is why i think they re so great they leave no marks on my baby s face they are easy to clean i strictly breastfeed and there has been no nipple confusion problems at all with these they are reasonably priced so it s easy to have them all over the house the pink and purple colors are fun 
5 5 loved it 
5 5 my baby loves these they fit great and are good quality the glow in the dark feature isn t really that important but it is kind of cool 
5 4 just another baby gift
5 5 my grandaughters favorite binkys 
5 5 bought this when son was 2 months and he didn t know what to do with it now at 4 months he adores this he pops the soothie in and out of his mouth kind of like a game to him haha the giraffe is super soft and lays right on his chest 
1 1 this product is fake do not buy the package on it is fake and the stuff animal is so poorly crafted it looks like its about to fall apart 
3 3 these are cute but my baby just didn t take to them 
5 5 perfect game i ended up having to print out more pacifiers because we had a big shower for my sister but no big deal because everyone loved this game the blindfold was just thin cardboard but it fit the kids and adults perfectly i would definitely recommend this product 
5 5 avent does not have many graphic choices when it comes to pacifiers these are cute and do glow
5 5 excelente producto
5 5 a little pricey but well worth it 
5 4 works and holds most of the time has come undone a couple of times always test before putting weight on it 
5 5 a shower gift that was requested by the mom to be it is cute she liked the gift 
5 5 does the job well as expected very affordable price 
5 5 we recently transitioned our daughter to a toddler bed this is the only rail that really fits safely on her convertible crib the same model as this rail purchased from target you have to have the piece of wood that comes with the crib to use this as it screw in very securely to the bed frame our daughter now sleeps on the edge of the bed right near this rail and it barely gives at all making us feel that she is safe and unlikely to fall out of bed it does only cover less than half of the length of the bed but if the child doesn t roll around too much they should be fine 
3 3 the scent is not what i prefer the powder is good 
4 4 we love baby jail i would have given 5 stars but the quality is a little lower than i expected one of the hinges was damaged when we opened the box it still functions right but we had to put a piece of duct tape over the sharp edge
5 5 the pictures provided don t do this cute little swing justice my son loves it originally we thought a plug option would be better but with batteries we can easily move it around the house or outside without needing an outlet we ve been using it heavily for 3 days and the batteries are still going strong 
3 3 it s okay because it s very lightweight and it s ideal for traveling but it s somewhat flimsy we had a hard time keeping our daughter on the folding potty seat because it would slip and move everywhere 
5 5 i am now a great grandmother and this book was everything i hopped for now if my granddaughter will fill it out kids these day ha ha
5 5 wife and i are having twins and decided to give this car seat a shot we received them pretty fast even though we live in fairbanks ak you can see that this is a good product right away another reason why we chose this carseat is because it is lightweight my wife is small and this being lightweight helps out a ton with her being able to carry them pretty easy the click connect is really handy when you put 2 car seats in either the stroller and in the car i will give a better update when the little ones arrive in a few weeks but so far so good 
5 5 ive only had these pouches a wk and i love them i blend up my baby food and freeze it in ice trays stick some frozen cubes in a pouch when we are on the go and she loves them also very easy to clean in dishwasher hope they last a long time 
3 3 it gets the job done but it s also a bit flimsy 
4 5 i love that it only weights 10 11 pounds it s much easier to get into my car the only downside is that if the baby isn t in the stroller sometimes it will to over if you ve put things in the handle empty it can handle the disorder bag but not the disorder bag and my purse 
5 5 great
5 1 eep 
5 5 i love the minky for the price it is worth it no leaks no rashes super diligent on changing diapers often does the job well without being ultra pricey
5 5 used for my newborn 4 mo old now and still using was 4 days late so these aren t only just for preemie babys great to use if you re also breastfeeding ordered 6 to go with the 6 dr browns bottles i ordered on amazon will probably order more bottles keeping the size 1 nipple that came with the bottles on standby for the next stage 
4 3 pretty color not very sturdy quite small compared to other mats will do only for infant or tiny toddler 
5 5 love the bed will buy from this buyer
5 5 bought as a gift for an upcoming baby shower but is the same brand i used when my children wore cloth diapers 
5 5 this is one of the most high quality well thought out baby thing i ve encountered it started with unpacking it actually had repacking instruction on the box and the manual this is great they thought ahead so we can pack it away between babies the instructions are also amazing a real rarity with baby products i m discovering to the important part i works very well you can choose the motion types and the speed you are bound to find something baby will like baby looked comfortable it s not rigid i wish the back support for the baby was a little more rigid so it doesn t curl the baby up it s good if you keep it reclined all the waythe speakers are the only drawback very cheap bad sounding speakers the motor isn t silent or very quiet but babies won t care about that some extras you can attache a phone or music player with provided headphone jackyou can control the whole thing with your phone with bluetooth 
5 5 i love it just what i was lookingfor
5 4 picture says it all 
1 1 i am a huge fan of the summer infant play yard that this product goes with but this canopy is absolute junk we bought it to shade our son on the beach during vacation and it broke the very first time we used it save your money completely unsatisfied with this purchase 
5 5 what a great idea perfect for teething babies and children with sensory issues 
1 1 do not buy this for your child it isn t safe 
5 1 we had a 34 normal 34 marathon 5 years ago and loved it this seat is impossible to 34 easily 34 install it s bulky and heavy and impossible to clean i am really disappointed with the clicktight addition and wish i could have my plain britax back 
5 5 this really helped us with the huge pile of stuffed animals that were scattered around the playroom now we have storage and seating 
5 5 bought this so i could use an already owned backpack as a diaper bag organizes diapers and wipes for two kids plus all the little things so they don t just get lost in the bottom and there s room left on top of the backpack to stash blankets and such perfect 
5 4 it dispenses bags well and with ease when you run out you can put a new roll of bags in its not spectacular in any way but it gets the job done
5 5 love this little plates good size for my 15 months son s meals 
1 5 returned person i gave it to said it wasn t needed in the particularplayard i bought
5 5 cute monkey
5 5 love it so cute
5 5 excellent product my granddaughter loves these pacifiers now we don t worry so much when they fall to the floor when we are out and about in public places 
5 5 i tried several pacifier brands and my girl loved this one the best no issues with breastfeeding when we introduced it which is what some people worry about 
5 5 great product for babies particularly those who need a pacifier but haven t mastered keeping it in their mouthes yet 
5 5 if you re a breastfeeding mom it s likely your baby will prefer these over the orthodontic kind they hold up great and are easy to clean follow manufacturer instructions 
2 1 i didn t get these 2 colors that was advertised when placing my order i got 2 pink i want these 2 colors i need it for a boy not a girl 
5 5 love love love this pacifier pod i now have 3 one on my diaper bag one on my car seat and one on my stroller it is so handy to always have a back up pacifier accessible at all times no digging through a full bag while the baby cries 
5 5 this is by far my sons favorite pacifier even at 1 month he was able to keep a hold of it longer than the average pacifier however you can find it cheaper at babies r us 
5 5 these feel absolutely amazing and are very soft well worth the money and super cute too it wasn t as sparkleally as expected but thay doesn t matter too much when they do the trick and calming down my little bratty baby thumbs up would buy again i expect nothing less than perfect from the germans :)
5 1 these were such a weird shape my baby never liked them and i don t blame him 
5 4 this item came exactly as described i loved the idea of this but it seems to be a little more trouble than it s worth my baby is only two months old so maybe it will work better for us as she gets older but right now it is just awkward the toy makes the angle of the pacifier hard to get in my baby s mouth depending on how i m holding her and the toy also makes it easy for her to grab it out of her mouth i will say that the toy makes it hard to lose the pacifier my house has become a pacifier graveyard they are everywhere the toy itself is soft and seems well made 
5 5 love the sports design very durable and strong for children who are teething 
5 5 bought these for my grandson not only do they look amazing but they are also his favorite pacifiers 
5 3 my son didn t like these pacis but i did the shape is great and the little handle is very handy
5 5 if your kid likes mams these are great easy to hold in there mouth by themselves and they look cute too the glow feature is awesome and they really do glow pretty bright in a dark room very helpful if baby drops binky and your searching with tired eyes 
5 5 baby loves her wubba very easy for her to find the nipple after taking a break from sucking the only downside is sanitizing nipple everyday can be quite a pain with having to avoid wetting dog 
5 5 very cute and worth the purchase 
5 5 i like this product it really does soothe 
5 5 we received one of these as a gift and our baby fell in love with it when we misplaced it i was thrilled that i could order a replacement on amazon prime the pacifier is a pretty universal one that can be found at any baby store it s actually branded soothie tm the lamb is just a plush stuffed toy that has been attached at the mouth to the pacifier they are permanently attached and the plush usually gets wet when i m washing the pacifier it does dry very fast so this is not an issue for us 
5 5 so cute
5 5 baby loved it
5 5 quite possibly the world s most perfect paci 
5 5 matches great fits security gives cozy feel and protection without making me nervous as cloth bumpers do 
3 3 i purchased it for my dogs but no interest on their part 
5 2 this potty is awesome in theory we ve only used it three times my little guy isn t quite ready to fully potty train but now it randomly has the 34 yay 34 music go off at random times even when no one is sitting on it or in the room with it there is no moisture or anything else for that matter in the toilet so no reason for the music to play very frustrating and confusing for a toddler you re trying to train to use the potty 
5 4 although i love the product i hate that it flaps in the wind when you drive on the freeway 
5 5 nicely packaged and no pacifier missing 
5 5 we started introducing bottle to our baby when she was 8 weeks old she didn t take dr brown pedietrician suggested playtex drop in natural latch on which has a flater and softer nipple she still didn t like it i kind of started worrying if we would have to try a million brands to figure out which she will take i ve heard about mam before so started with mam lucky us the first time she latched on it was not perfect but at least she didn t resist or play with it the 2nd time she finished 2 oz now she is 13 weeks no problem with bottle feeding any more thank you mam for such a great product 
5 4 2nd favorite after mam 
5 5 great for what it is i am sure but does not work well for kids with high arched palates it s suggested that you size up so they have more surface area and will have more success holding on to the pacifier on their own 
5 5 this is the only 34 cork 34 that my baby will accept
5 4 it is very little 
5 5 i buy a set of these for every friend that has a new baby they are adorable and always get a laugh 
4 1 my baby hated this thing she was scared of the stuffed animal however using this weaned her from the pacifier so maybe that s a good thing 
5 3 honestly i wanted to wait to add my review and im glad i did first off its super cute it does its job and helps to hold the paci and we have yet to lose it either so thats great when i first got it i thought 34 i wonder how long before that comes off the animal 34 as it didn t look all that stable its been maybe a month and its barely hanging on there my son is 11 weeks and doesn t grab things yet to pull or anything and it hasnt been washed even though the label says you can its literally just falling off very sad since its so expensive too:(
4 3 mouth guard a little large 
3 2 too heavy my son doesn t like them 
5 4 love the look of the machine looks really cool works very well only for the drying function sometimes if i m sterlizing 5 6 bottles at one time after steam and dry for 60 mins they are not completely dried that i have to add another 30mins just to dry them other than that i love this machine 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my baby will use over this last year we have brought over 10 packs they are of excellent quality but the baby likes to make them disappear so we like having plenty of back up 
5 5 i love these pacifiers their open air design doesn t leave a rash on my daughter s sensitive skin 
5 5 can t live without these in our house my daughter loves the frog arrived exactly as pictured will definitely be ordering ore of these in the event that this one gets lost or breaks 
5 5 these are nfl endorsed and are absolutely adorable they are the perfect gift for that packers fan with a new baby they are a bit big though so not for newborns but for older infants 
5 5 my daughter loves feeling the monkey while she sucks and falls asleep i had to change out the pacifier because she doesn t like the soothies she prefers the orthodontic pacifiers
2 3 they dont have a hole for the strap
5 5 these are too funny great ice breaker at a bar 
4 4 i love that this is an all natural material pacifier my baby will take it once in a while for nap time and likes it the best over other pacifiers but she isn t a huge fan the reason i think she doesn t like and the reason i don t like it is because of its smell it smells like a latex glove unfortunately there s no way around it after i sterilized it i rubbed coconut oil on it and rinsed it helped but didn t fully get rid of the smell other than the smell it s great it touches baby s nose so for breastfed babies it s more natural feeling and there s no yucky questionable ingredients that s why i bought it 
5 5 great set 
5 5 daughter loves these she can hang onto it at 3 mo doesn t spit it out as easily 
5 5 love it a favorite in our house 
5 2 look for other ones this one is all carbord and you have to use tape or buy a thing of pins 
5 5 got what i wanted
5 4 awesome quality baby loves it the pacifier has not come off in 8 months 
5 5 i love these my aunt gave me a set of normal mam pacifiers which we love the glow in the dark set is fantastic for middle of the night feedings other emergencies no more crawling around in the dark patting the floor in search of the missing pacifier they charge up in about 5 seconds when held up to a light and stay charged for hours the glow does not seem to bother my son we love it because it is a mini glow stick for sleep deprived parents 
5 5 it s soft and flexible she used it at the hospital and doesn t like any kind of pacifier but this one glad i was able to find it not sold in stores
5 5 these pacifiers are so cute and my son loves them they are very durable and easy to clean my son is also able to hold them easily the bright colors make them easy to spot if they happen to fall or get thrown we have used mam pacifiers for both of our kids and have never been disappointed 
5 5 exactly what i expected
5 5 chicco pacifiers are the only one we used since our son was born 13 months ago we tried other ones but chicco has the best quality and is easy to clean does not collect liquids inside like others love this brand 
5 5 excelente
5 5 cutest thing ever i die when i see my son using this pacifier stays in mouth and cleans well 
5 5 my dautgher loves it its her favorite one it s nice size for her mouth too 
5 5 thank you my new grandson loves them thanks
5 5 baby and i are very happy with the mam bottles and pacifiers 
5 5 all 3 of my kids each had their own longhorn wubbanub they are great and are easier for your baby to hold and keep from falling on the ground perfect for any longhorn fan 
5 5 excellent bink never hits the ground 
5 4 our newborn photographer had us get these to use during the photoshoot since they don t leave any type of ring around babies mouths she likes these pacis and these specific ones are a great price but we prefer the soothies with the wubbanubs wubbanubs are much easier for my daughter to hold and maneuver and they re much easier for us to find especially in the middle of the night but these are great to have on standby for the times when they re in the wash 
5 2 this is adorable and i love the concept it makes it so much easier for small babies to keep the pacifier in their mouth and so helpful to keep track of the pacifier tha dragon is very cute and cuddly but the pacifier broke off after less than a month of use a bit disappointing for the cost
5 5 a great laugh but as a pacifier my son did not like it great idea and a good price
1 2 one had a hole in it and was useless otherwise these are the only ones my son likes 
5 5 grand baby loved the one that i got previously and i decided to purchase another one for the pregnant daughter of a dear friend these are the best not only are they cute but baby learns to hold on to something soft and cuddly 
5 4 my baby is now 5 months and she has been using this pacifier for her naps and nighttime sleep since she was about 1 month old i gave her a soothie to use before and bought this thinking i d only use it as back up or when we go somewhere because it has a handle that i can attach a holder clip the first time i had my baby used this i could see by the way that she was sucking it that it was a lot more comfortable and fit better in her mouth than the soothie because the nipple is softer more flattened and has a narrow base the pacifier stays in her mouth better than the soothie it will stay in her mouth sometimes the entire length of her nap or for a few hours each night before falling out even after she stopped sucking with the soothie it kept falling out of her mouth as soon as she stopped sucking the other day i tried to give her her soothie back to try again and she sucked it and it fell out of her mouth i kept putting it back in but either she pushed it out with her tongue or it was falling out because of the way she was sucking she was used to how this pacifier kinda 34 hangs 34 in mouth better because of the narrow base and fatter nipple so i actually tried sucking on both pacifiers myself this one is much softer and natural feeling than the stiff straight nipple of the soothie if i was a baby i d definitely prefer sucking on this one i personally think it probably resembles a real nipple more because of its soft compressed flatter nipple i breastfeed and when my baby feeds my nipple looks flattened when she pulls off the only negative about this pacifier is that water gets into the inside of the pacifier whenever i wash them i always wash them by hand with some warm water and soap and always get water into the nipple it leaks in somehow from the base i don t think there s a way to take of the base without breaking it to clean the inside but i guess it doesn t matter because that part doesn t come in contact with my baby s mouth it is unsightly though seeing water spots on the inside of the nipple makes it look dirty we have really hard water though so that may be why i always shake the water out as much as i can and let it air dry before giving it to my baby 
5 4 good
5 4 hard to open when you are sleepy or in darkness
3 3 it s not the pacifiers fault i think my son just doesn t like them still searching for the right one
5 5 cute design and baby adapted very easily to head 
5 5 supper cute
5 5 this has been a lifesaver for us i ve seen a ton of moms and babies with these but didn t know what they were called a friend had twins and said they couldn t do it without the wubbanub we soon learned the only pacifier our daughter liked was an avent soothie but she would drop it at night after a few nights of screaming after she knocked it out of her mouth on purpose we sent grammie and pop pop to find a wubbanub they brought us 34 lamby 34 i love the little cross on it it reminds me to thank god for our precious blessing and she loves it she actually holds it herself but it can be tucked into a swaddle or shirt 
5 5 good
3 2 i had bought the newborn gumdrop pacifiers for my baby and decided to change to the infant size style recently since he was getting older however i noticed he was spitting out the pacifier a lot and it seemed like he had a hard time sucking on it and keeping it in his mouth eventually i ended up buying the mam pacifiers which he keeps in his mouth for forever so unfortunately the infant size style did not work well with my baby :(
5 5 love this pacifier and so does my baby next time though i won t buy the transparent one in the middle of the night it can be very hard to find the colorful ones stick out more 
5 5 love that we haven t lost this one yet 
5 5 these are our favorite type of paci just great quality and we like the 34 air 34 design which doesn t smother that sweet delicate face skin 
5 5 these bottles are so much better then the tommie tippie everyone kept telling me to get i feel the nipple on these are closer to nature and she seems to spill a lot less with these plus they come completely apart so you can clean them really well 
5 5 i have two babies that started on nuk brand pacifiers which worked ok but those have have an asymmetrical design so you can accidentally put it in upside down those also have a ring that they grab onto and end up pulling out of their mouths we have tried a couple others but they did not seem to enjoy them much i prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you re fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up they have a nub to hold onto with is great because it provides a decent handle to hold onto but the babies don t grab onto them and pull them out so easily the glow in the dark feature is great too makes them easy to locate in the crib at night 
5 5 my baby loves it it s easy to find in the crib she looks adorable sucking on it
5 1 my son isn t a fan of this item but he might just need to grow into it 
5 5 easy to find in the middle of the night because they glow in the dark which is a fantastic feature love this product and will continue to use 
5 4 wife loves it looks nice drying feature is a plus 
5 3 i am sure these are great but my son did just fine from day one with the bigger pacifiers i don t see a need for these and he didn t care for them 
5 5 my daughter is two months old and the wubbanub is a life saver it s easy for her to hold on to and i adore watching her cuddle with it 
3 2 the box fits 2 avent soothies and keeps it clean however it does not stay attached to backpack strap nothing to secure in place 
1 2 the new shape is awful my son hates these pacifiers and refuses to use them what a waste 
5 5 lost the grandsons needed the same as hospital perfect match not hard like in stores 
5 5 these are cute and my son loves them what more could i ask for 
5 5 my daughter started eating oranges from this at 6 months old and she loves it we use it about weekly it also doubles as a teether some say it is hard to open and close it is a bit tough so for you grandparents with arthritis you may have a hard time it just takes a pit of patience otherwise i found it to be a very sturdy product as far as the mesh netting goes i have had no discoloration on mine after 3 months of use it still looks new i boil my daughters bottles and i just dip the mesh in the boiling water they do make replacement netting if your concerned about the coloring 
5 5 my baby love wubbanub pacifier 
5 5 bought as gift
5 4 my daughter loves it i just wish you were able to separate it from the toy so that i could add the 3 month pacifier to the toy 
5 5 baby loves it keeps her busy long enough to get mommy stuff done :)
5 5 as a parent you know the importance of having lots of binkys these are great for the price 
1 5 for other people interested in purchasing i was wondering what 34 0 plus months 34 meant in the description i just received the pacifiers and the box says 34 newborn 34 so just fyi for other people interested in purchasing this item i had to give it a star rating so i gave it 5 but we actually have to return them didn t want to rate as a 1 since we didn t try them and will just be returning them since the age is too young for us 
5 5 we love them 
5 4 good
5 5 just received these today and my son 4 months old loves it we originally bought the gumdrops pacifier for him but he kept spitting them out as soon as i put this one in his mouth he hasn t spit it out yet he s been just relaxing and sucking on his new pacifier for probably the past ten minutes which is a miracle great buy 
5 5 great quality as always but bottom one is not a grey blue color very light clear ish teal 
5 5 great for a good suck 
5 5 my daughter loves these the stuffed animal makes it easier to find it and my little one loves holding on to it when she s got the pacifier in her mouth 
5 5 a huge hit at the baby shower baby not born yet but i know it s gonna be awesome 
5 5 great product i have been using it for four months i hand wash with natural baby soap and hot water i am ordering two more now 
5 3 these were the first pacifiers i tried for my newborn but she didn t take to them also when you clean them they fill up with water and is kind of hard to squeeze out 
5 5 better price than in store even walmart breastfed post tongue lip tie revision baby takes these bottles and pacifier well 
5 5 great product it comes with the soothie paci well attached to the fuchsia giraffe easy to use washes beautifully and baby likes it 
5 5 this is one of my twin s favorite pacifiers i m not sure if its the darker colored nipple or something else but we ve tried a handful of others and this is always his favorite 
5 4 nice pacifers
5 5 i love that the light up at night which allows me to find them more easily in the dark 
5 1 made the wipes smell mildewy
5 5 great product
5 5 use this to hold my cloth wipes in my diaper bag and i love it 
1 5 be aware there are two different nipple shapes i ordered the wrong ones the first time amazon graciously refunded me my little switched from another major brand to these with no problem after i heard a disturbing story about a pacifier being swallowed into the airway because it was too small and all one piece yikes these have the handle on the back that make me less nervous i like that these are not dyed as well a grest product 
4 2 does not work that great 
5 5 as expected 
5 5 my little one loves it 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 great product
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my daughter will use good quality 
5 3 the medicine pacifier hole is too big for my newborn the thermometer pacifier is nice but my son is picky about his pacifier nipple size so he tries to spit this out great concept though 
5 5 good monitor and has a lot of options that is not so easy to use 
1 5 water stays warm bottle stays tightly sealed no leaks 5 star product 
5 5 my little girl loves this elephant we got it as a baby shower gift and it became her favorite lovie it s nice small and thin so i never had to worry about her sleeping with it we actually lost it right after she turned 1 and i had to rush order another one from amazon because she wont sleep without it it is also made very well we have washed and dried it more times than i can count and never had any problems 
5 5 very good quality and secure baby seat i found it to be one of the most confortable seats on the market and by far amount beautiful and simple my only problem with this prodcut was amazon package handling and shippment i bought it overseas and payed 1 3 of the price only for shipping it first issue was the color availability on the site there were plenty of options but only one could be shipped to my country second issue was the package i received it on time but totally wet with the box melting down due to exposition to water gladly inside the melted packaged the seat was intact besides the bad smelling due water i just cleaned everything very well put it to dry and nice my babe loves his new seat i do recommend this seat i saw one of these keep a baby alive in a very odd car accident before it is very very safe and strong 
5 5 got this to help ease bathing the dogs but of course will be using it also for our baby girl coming later this year 
5 5 i bought a cheap one before ended up throwing it away this aquaus diaper sprayer serves me well 
5 5 i love the travel container and my baby loves this spoon i m a first time mom and it was so overwhelming trying to find a spoon to use with our baby now that we re trying solid foods this one is soft on her gums and the shape makes it easy for us to angle it up when feeding her without food getting all over the place i bought more to have in our rotation highly recommend
5 5 very useful brush for it s intended purpose i will keep purchasing 
5 5 very good does the job
3 3 i didn t like that you couldn t take it apart for easy storage it comes in one solid piece it serves it s purpose but i would spend the extra money to get medela parts in the future 
5 5 love it love it love it
5 5 very good i bought it for my 7 months old babies and it keep them inside improvement need to improve on suction so it will stay up and more sturdy
5 5 we haven t used it yet but after one wash it fits great on the babyletto mini pure core mattress which is 3inches thick quality is good material is soft i will update if we have issues once we start using it 
5 5 loved this ceiling medallion what a great accent for a nursery 
5 4 fit my medela pump in style to pump directly into avent bottles yay
5 5 if you breastfeed you know what it does to your skin it makes your skin hard and flaky and sometimes even painful i knew there had to be a cream out there that actually worked then i saw this nursing mama nipple cream by anna naturals and knew that it was something i had to try out this cream is very creamy and soft when you apply it the smell was a sweet smell nothing too strong or irritating for baby this cream has actually done wonders and made my skin softer and less painful not once has my daughter and a reaction to it so i know that it is safe for babies i am very pleased with this product and think that every nursing mother should own some i received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review 
5 3 this product doesn t work well if you have a big 9 months old baby 17 lbs i was not happy with my purchase my son did not feel secure when i wore him with this product i felt like i had to hold as well so this wrap felt useless i am sure it is great for younger and smaller baby 
5 5 wife never stayed with breast feeding but very good products by medela
5 5 great product my son used this product on a recent car trip and he loved it it is super high quality for the price and is the perfect size pillow for toddlers and small children i would highly recommend this to parents looking for a small people for their little one to travel with take to daycare or preschool or any other occasion this product was also shipped very fast and was packaged very well 
5 4 as expected 
4 5 i actually got this for myself and have been using it for about a week now i had nasal surgery and have not been able to blow my nose yet for 2 weeks i am able to use a nasal spray for congestion and also saline spray and gently blow and got permission to use a baby aspirator so i came on amazon and found this figuring this would be a much better choice than the bulb type i used on my kids when they were babies i haven t been disappointed this little gem is great it s quick easy to put together take apart rinse wash etc it is a little tricky to use on yourself but very doable lol if your mucus is thick and you have to suck really hard it is possible to suck some of what s in the little cup through the tubing but it is very obvious if this happens so it doesn t get far it s quick and easy to take the tube off rinse it out put it back together i even dried the tubing out with my hair dryer the one thing i think could be better is the tip could be a little more rounded as even though it is a very soft rubber when your nasal passages are raw and or sore the slightest bit of edge is painful and or uncomfortable it hurts a bit for me to let it touch but this aspirator has been great for me being unable to blow my nose and having bad allergies i just have to be sure not to go in too far also be careful which part you re putting in your mouth if you re using it on yourself ;)
5 5 i am so happy with the purchase of my little pillow my 15 month old son has been using his little pillow for a couple of weeks and seems to really like it it is the perfect size the best part of this purchase is the personal customer service 
5 5 strong useful well built easy set up a little talle than the average infant gate i am completely satisfied 
4 4 it works good but my only complaint is that it s kind of a pain because you have to wash the diapers then wash with the product then treads again obviously that s kind of a pain but it does work 
5 5 love this product i got the baby buller as a gift but u love using this instead for some of her food i stopped buying jarred baby food a d this makes it easier to make food at home 
4 3 only stays wound for a minute but otherwise it s very cute and colorful 
5 5 easy to install prevents compressed lines in our leather seats extra pockets are a bonus 
3 3 i like the concept but the stickiness of back wears off i ve only had this for a week and the one i used on my cabinet below my kitchen sink came off already probably won t buy again
5 2 i regret buying this item for 2 reasons 1 it does not fit in to my dr brown s 4oz bottles 2 the soap dispensing feature which prompted me to buy this in the first place does not work well at all 
1 1 dangerous it a choking hazard for baby s before you even put them on they fall apart
3 3 i purchased this to attach to my baby s bumbo tray as he was always dropping his toys it is a nice looking toy although my baby didn t seem too interested in it my biggest problem with this toy was that it doesn t stay attached well at all i don t know if it s because it is too top heavy or if the suction cup isn t made well but if you so much as move the seat this topples over very frustrating so we do not use it often at all 
5 5 well packed came on time and work great got more for my money than expected 
5 4 works well bottom and top latches don t latch at the same time but so far it still keeps my 10 month old out of the kitchen 
5 1 i ordered the red set i received purple and the seller says that there is nothing wrong and that product is as described i sent them pictures and they apparently don t see the difference between red and purple they are literally arguing with me about the color my butterflies look nothing like the picture not happy at all 
5 5 super soft and cuddly 
5 3 i purchased the item for my 8 month old son and he loves it he s now able to move around the house freely and you can see the joy of independence on his face every time he moves off i had hopped for more activity items on the walker i e lights etc but other than that it was a good buy and offered value for money 
5 4 this is easy to put together and a cinch to use folding it up is a bit tricky as it seems counter intuitive love that it can hold a ton of stuff and i m not lugging a car seat around or a standard size stroller 
5 5 just right
5 5 love the mat so happy about the purchase rolls up very light and travels easily we take it to other people s houses and on vacations haven t taken it on the plane yet awesome on vacation because you don t want your baby crawling and playing around on gross hotel room carpet perfect size cover washes great and easy to get on it also is a great neutral color that works well with the dcor of most rooms it works great on rugs tile and wood floors i ve never seen it slip on tile note i saw some reviews saying that the cover was hard to get back on once it had been washed but i completely disagree super easy and i m usually terrible with stuff like that i wash it once a week and i ve never had a problem recommendations to manufacturer 1 sell replacement covers so i can use the mat while the i m washing the cover 2 maybe offer a bigger mat option if people want to fill up an entire room a more permanent mat solution the only con is the price very expensive for a play mat but worth it organic high quality and made in the usa would purchase a dozen more if i could 
5 5 these work as expected we had some already and just ordered more my son who is into everything isn t able to break them off so that s a win 
5 2 my 9 month old was able to take them off oh so easily 
5 5 these baby girl headbands with chiffon flowers have nice stretchy bands to accommodate girls up to age 10 per the manufacturer the bands fit my 9 y o granddaughter without any discomfort and she adores them i d say that boho style is an excellent description for these headbands the flowers petals aren t smoothly cut which actually gives them more volume and a much more natural look than if they had been cut smoothly there are some stray bits of hot glue residue here there to pick off but not too much and it s easy to pick off if it s bothersome some of the headband colors aren t the exact same shade as the flower on them which is sort of weird but the colors don t actually clash and it lends to the whole nonchalant boho natural style thing these have going on the price of these headbands seems to make them a good value compared to prices i ve seen for other similar headbands and most important of all my granddaughter didn t care if the shades were a bit different or if they had a tiny touch of glue to a petal here or there she thinks they re adorable just like they are and is looking forward to matching the flowers up with different outfits she owns i took a picture of her happily trying on the pink headband and you can see her eyes sparkling with delight so i think the verdict is in little girls love these headbands provided for evaluation and review purposes 
5 5 i have tried so many sippy cups for my son and the all leaked i was a little nervous about spending money on yet another sippy cup but this cup is great my son is just over one and is really rough he throws is cup in the ground all the time this cup not only keeps his drink cold for hours but it won t leak if it is dropped or tipped the only time it leaks is if i shake it upside down with a lot of force so pleased with this purchase 
5 5 this was a gift for our grand daughter she found it to be helpful 
4 4 i did not experience the strong odor like other commenters noted my baby took to this without an issue previously we were using soothie pacifiers only my only comment is that the handle has been sticking together but doesn t necessarily feel sticky i m writing this after having the product for about five days 
3 3 we bought this because of the design and the price but we have quickly learned that the good looks aren t worth the trouble like another reviewer said it is very easy to trip over the legs also the arm straps are two big and there is no way to adjust them to make them work at 7 months our daughter is in the 95th percentile for height the arm straps are hanging loose now to cleaning food gets stuck everywhere and mostly under the cushion making it very hard to clean mold builds up and this is not nice i though it was cute because it can turns into a chair but i don t think we will keep it that long it was fairly easy to put together and the design is nice but i wouldn t buy it again 
5 5 love mam these come with sterilizable case which is very handy 
5 5 the happy cloud mattress pad is a very important thing for all cribs protecting the crib mattress is very important its where you child will sleep for majority of his childhood until they are out of their cribs the mattress pad is very nicely made the seems are tight and there was no loose stings hanging from it the mattress pad stays on nice and secure after a couple of nights with my son tossing and turning it hasn t moved at all it is also machine washable for any incident the little one may have when its time to put it back on the mattress its extremely easy i would recommend it to all parents and any parents to be i received this product in return for my honest unbiased review the discount has not changed my view on this product 
5 4 nice pacifers
5 3 you only get two kind of deceiving given the price and picture 
5 5 love it i had no idea what these were for i thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers i didn t realize i needed one until i was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier quickly i ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier it took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and i immediately cleaned it and put it to use it works great my two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired despite my best efforts for naps to help her settle down i haven t used it in the car yet which is where i need it most but i m sure it ll be great it s nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort the only downfall i see with the design of the product is that you can t take the paci off to really clean it yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and i did that i just wish i could run it through my dishwasher like i do the other things to make sure it s really sterilized but then i m kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea the fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter s tiny hands can really grab onto it she seems to like the soft feel the little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing the pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that the fabrics are bright and cute i love the little thing 
5 5 works like a charm my daughter loved it up until my wife and i got her to stop using which was a slight challenge at 18 months they should definitely be trained to get off pacifiers i did try other products but none could compare to avent pacifiers 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my daughter will use when she is really tired we ve tried every other brand out there even similarly shaped while on occasion she ll take a different paci when it comes down to actually falling asleep these are the only ones that have worked for us 
5 5 my grandson loves these pacifiers we haven t lost one yet this one is so stink in cute 
5 4 this thing is so cute it s smaller in person than i thought it d be more like the size of a beanie baby but in reality would you want something any bigger for an infant probably not way cute can t wait to give it to my baby someday yes i am that lame hopeful woman who is ttc and ordering baby items early :):)
5 5 great
5 5 great sanitary pacifier with cover
5 5 best pacifiers ever never ever gets dirty when dropped 
5 5 excellent
5 3 my baby took time to get usedto these pacifiers she was using the avent newborn and those are a bit harder and these are way too soft i feel like she doesn t feel anything in her mouth i don t like that soap gets stuck inside when i wash it 
5 5 my wife keeps wanting more 
5 5 aint nobody like nuk they seem to have the best pacis around 
5 5 good
5 3 my baby kinda liked these for about 5 minutes and now she won t take any kind of pacifier not great if you re trying to get a kid to take a pacifier but great if you don t want them to get too attached 
5 3 showed blue and yellow shipped pink and i purchased for a boy will save for a different baby i guess 
5 5 i adore these and so does my little guy so much more attractive than so many of the other options out there i get a ton of compliments on them when out with my son and feel good knowing i m giving him the best we have a couple of soothies too but multiple times i ve seen him gag with those where as the more natural shape of these seems to prevent that 
5 5 very cute elephant our daughter loves the soothe pacifier and having the elephant on it makes it cuter and gives her something to hold plus it stays in her mouth better 
5 3 cute
5 4 absolutely luv it
5 5 its super cute and came im cute little heart shaped containers 
5 5 the nicu introduced our daughter to these paci s they are a life saver hospitals trust them in preemies 
5 5 great product
5 1 these pacifiers don t have a smooth tip like other brands it s more textured my baby hated it 
4 5 this is the only brand my daughter will take so obviously it is 5 stars 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers that my breast fed little one will use easy to clean and the little handle on the front is perfect for attaching a binky clip or for his little hands 
5 5 wubbanubs are the best my little one has about 20 and they are both pacifiers and toys i don t know what we would do without wubbanubs 
5 5 i cannot say enough about this product even other parents stop me and either rave about how great they think it also is or they want to know where i got it my daughter started teething at three months and while looking for things that would work for her teething i came across this style binky our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth this toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate it is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky i can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place it makes a fun toy as well she loves spying her binky and getting to play with it and feel the softness of the toy 
5 5 my little girl loves these pacifiers 
5 5 these are the pacifiers that my hospital gave us for our daughter as a new mom i was too careless with them they were lost within two weeks and i quickly learned that my recklessness was going to come at a cost these are the only soothies that my daughter would use we tried others and she would just spit them right back out i made it a point to purchase a pack of these immediately in store and then order these ones as a back up it s that critical to have spares do not mess around i found that these soothies work great whether your are breast or bottle feeding we did both and i found that it helped her transition between nipples well no latch confusion it also helps to be able to insert your finger into the hole if your baby is teething so they can alternate between sucking on the soothie and clamping down for their gums also these things are so easy to sterilize and i ve never had an issue with them ripping if only i could get my second to use them 
5 5 i love mam bottles nipples and pacifiers my lo does too 
5 5 my son absolutely loves this pacifier 
5 5 my daughter lost hers while at a restaurant so we had to purchase a new one she had a hard time going to sleep without her giraffe good thing we have prime so we only had to go without for a few days 
5 3 love all wubbas and we have 7 of them this one is a little more diifficult at keeping in the mouth in the crib bc of the elephant trunk
5 5 so fun 
3 4 they get a little tacky after a while maybe it s just me my son won t really take any pacifier but on the occasion he will take this for a few minutes
5 5 looks nice
5 5 so very cute 
5 5 my son loves these 
5 5 great product
5 3 these do not stay in my son s mouth very well when i bought the more traditional pacifiers they work a lot better for us 
5 5 absolutely adore these pacifiers my daughter and her husband farm and of course have john deere equipment this is great for either a boy or girl and just cute as ever 
5 1 im not really satified with this beacuse the pacifier cant be takin out so i can wash plush it self beofre giving it to my one month old baby
5 5 my lo was teething and the drool was hanging out under her bink causing a rash that wouldn t go away a few days with these and it s gone we re sticking to these now 
5 5 durable and easy to clean
5 5 this pacifier was absolutely adorable one of my favorites as well as my nieces favorite and it made it here in two days
5 5 my sons love these pacifiers and i do too 
5 5 best investment for baby i bought a back up just in case we lose it our baby loves holding the lovey while she sucks on the pacifier or just to have a toy to hold it also stays in her mouth better since the lovey rests on her chest i also tuck it into the car seat or carrier so that she doesn t lose it and she usually can get it back in her mouth on her own when she wants to 4 months now i highly recommend these and they are my go to gift for new parents also 
5 4 cute and cheaper on amazon than in stores 
5 4 i love jasmine giraffe 34 pacy 34 my 3 month old granddaughter is able to hold on to the 34 toy 34 and keeps her 34 pacy 34 in place most of the pictures i get my granddaughter is holding on to they toy giraffe i am going to buy more to add to the collection loved the product 
5 4 ahh what a desperate parent won t do to try to keep their baby calm and aid with sleeping this is a super cute paci and it s a bummer that my kiddo just didn t take to pacis at all nice quality 
5 1 horrable the product has no packing i bought to give to a friend as a gift but i cannot give something to a baby that i am not sure it its clean or safe 
5 5 good price obviously if you are buying these you know what you are looking for so a 34 review 34 isn t entirely necessary these are the type that we ve always received from the hospital at birth but for the next step beyond newborn 
5 4 helps keep baby happy by passie staing in place also gives baby a friend close by love it 
5 5 my daughter loves these
5 5 just like the hospital supplied our daughter loved them before switching to her thumb 
5 5 great itemm 
5 5 my favorite pacifier it s natural and it looks so cute it s very light weight i mention that because i thought it d be heavy for some reason 
5 5 works great if dropped it closes and so doesn t get the pacifier dirty very cute and a light green color
5 5 perfect
5 3 love that it is made in italy and from plant based rubber but the binky is huge my son is 3 months even with the butterfly indent the pacifier just about covers his nose i m not sure how practical this would be for a younger baby i think it just may be too big 
5 2 it looked nice but not on a newborn it is really big it hits her nose plus she did not like it at all and she like the avent orthodontic soothers classic more plus that one comes with a cover the price is great but i had to wait until i decide to buy something else so i can add it 
5 5 amazing binky just like the one they gave us at the hospital it s the only kind our baby will take i think the vanilla scent is soothing 
5 5 great and funny looking pacifiers after searching through amazon i decided to buy these because of the two different styles the mustache texture on the pictures looked pretty soft after receiving them the mustache material is soft and rubbery not the hard plastic kind this makes them even an better even better value 
5 5 very cute styles and good quality pacifier they are machine washable so very eay to clean for thw inevitable spills 
1 1 i love mam pacifiers and have actually bought the girl astronauts twice once after we lost an originals the second set to arrive however was not the set pictured i m pretty careful about checking for 34 colors may vary 34 or 34 designs may vary 34 on amazon but this product description doesn t say that anywhere and thought i was safe since i d bought this exact product here before wrong instead of kickin girl affirming astronauts i got stereotypical pink motifs you find everywhere very disappointed :(
5 4 we got the green version originally of these pacifiers she loved her pacifiers when she was newborn but when we saw the pink and purple we thought we d try it the pink pacifier blends in with things so we tend to lose track of it it s almost clear in color keep in mind the pacifiers have month recommendations on these it s recommended to use this type until 3 months sadly after the 3 month mark our baby does not want a pacifier anymore also i could never find a good way to clip the pacifier to a pacifier clip 
4 4 i should have read the description it only comes with two instead of four 
1 2 so i got this product and it was never delivered was refused a replacement or a refund which frankly is bs i looked everywhere and i never got the product that was not my fault so i just got another it s fine but it s not as pictured the one i got was brown and pretty cheap looking needless to say i should have just accepted that i wasted my money twice 
5 5 absolutely love these attaches securely to our lo s stroller and diaper bag easy to open and can store two easily a good buy 
5 5 my nephew will only stay calm with these pacifiers and has become much less gassy we buy these in the bulk 
5 5 we have used these for all 3 of our children we love the giraffe very prompt delivery after a not so good transaction with another seller thanks 
3 4 good pacifier but over time it gets sticky and delaminates 
5 5 my baby loves these these pacifiers nipple is a little bit bigger which made it easier for my baby to keep them in her mouth she only uses them at sleep time or as a soother when she s particularly upset and they ve helped settle her down big fan 
5 5 best pacifier on the market hands down we have tried many pacifiers like the soothie which she liked for a little while but never kept it in well and avent pacifiers but she took to these the best she isn t a big pacifier baby until recently as her teeth began coming in she can keep it in her mouth well especially at night for bed time it s easy to clean and is comfortable for her 
5 5 wubbanubs are so perfect for newborns that have a hard time keeping their paci in their mouth for about 6 months it is all my daughter would take now i get them for all my friends and family s new babies and they always love them not to mention how darn cute they are :)
5 5 these are my daughters favorite i thought they looked strange at first but got used to them she loves them great quality they hold up better than any other brand and we ve tried every orthodontic pacifier 
5 5 my nephew will only stay calm with these pacifiers and has become much less gassy we buy these in the bulk 
5 4 love this true to color sadly baby girl only used it for a few days before swearing off pacifiers but it s cute and she gnaws on it every now and again 
5 5 i love these and my son prefers them over all other brands the colors are soft and subtle very cute and they stay in the mouth perfect size for young babies 
4 5 i love this and at first i thought it would be too big for my newborn but because of how it s made its actually easy for her to keep it in her mouth because the elephant lays on her chest downside is the pacified can t be removed from the elephant since its sewn on so cleaning it can only be by hand so you would have to be extra careful it doesn t get dirty since t can t go in he laundry machine but it s cute a great size and my newborn has no issues sucking on the pacifier 
1 1 this listing is not for an authentic fctry brand pacifier my son loves the original so we ordered him another one what arrived did not come in the factry packaging but a plain bag which was our first clue next we sterilized it immediately after receiving it the mustache portion turned a dull black the clear plastic body became cloudy and the handle became stuck to the mustache portion the pacifier portion is made of a thinner cheap feeling silicone that feels like my child could bite right through it i am not be comfortable letting my child use this pacifier this item will be returned as soon as possible 
5 5 prefect in every way 
5 5 great quality
5 5 great toy for baby even before they can roll around and move much just know there is no cushion on that fabric bit wouldn t reccomend use on hardwood floor without some sort of extra padding underneath still an awesome toy none the less 
4 4 we love it the only complaint i have is that it get really hot after a while wish it was made out material that breathes better baby sweats really bad in it 
4 5 what i like most about these thermos containers is that the liquid will stay cold for a long time i haven t tested exactly how long but i live in southern california and it can get very hot here i will put water with ice in these and leave the house with the kids around 9 am and the water is still cold when we eat lunch around 1 pm while i do not use this for milk or juice i can see that these would work well to carry milk out of the house for later they are easy to clean and i like they are not made of plastic i believe the straw parts are silicone this is great if your kids tend to chew on the straw like mine do these are very durable it is a little hard to take apart sometimes for cleaning but once you get the hang of it it s fine this is dishwasher safe although the cap would likely melt if it falls into the heating unit of your dishwasher the top has three parts the plastic lid the straw that goes in your mouth and the long tube to reach for the liquid my husband tends to forget to add the straw and without it you cannot drink this cup is very durable it will leak if your child shakes it holds it upside down and sometimes it may splash a drop when popped open but because i use this for water it isn t a problem as it has not proved to be at all messy but i would not recommend for younger toddlers that shake their cups these asin b00ohkrm5a playtex playtime straw sippy cup super friends 9 ounce worked really well when my kids were younger 
4 3 a lot smaller and thinner than i thought but it will work temporarily 
5 4 works great use foamy shelf liner for your kids to sit on otherwise they ll start sliding out from under the harness 
5 4 really wish they weren t discontinuing this cup i m on baby 2 and just now have found these that do not leak i love them been through countless cups of all brands munchkin nuby etc and these are by far the best 
5 5 had a spot for everything loved it
5 5 this cloth diaper is very soft to the touch comfortable and cost efficient i recommend this pocket diaper to anyone wanting to add another cute design to their cloth diaper stash
4 4 slightly smaller than an average switch plate 
5 5 my daughter s favorite toy starting at 3 months the first toy she loved because it was easy for her to get a hold of 
5 1 we ordered this because we loved the design for our baby s room it took my husband about five hours to put together horrible instrutcions almost every single screw head stripped out very easily making construction a very difficult process several different screw drivers were tried we finally put it together but know that it is cheap quality and not worth the price paid for it it strangely leans a bit forward as well on a flat surface so if it were to fall forward all of the drawers would easily fall out i would not recommend buying this product 
5 5 i swear by these swaddles i started using them with my first child and was so happy to see they came in a premie size for my second my kids have to be wrapped tight to make it through the night i feel safe using these over a flannel blanket or muslin they are easy to put on and stay put i love the variety of colors and patterns as well 
5 5 expectations met
5 5 these are great easy to remove or put back on my 3 year old loves to take them down to look out the window and put them up when it s sunny 
5 5 no rust yay 
5 5 very good
5 4 exactly what she already has love it
5 5 awsome
5 5 these were great 
5 5 my son never used a pacifier as a pacifier but he used this as a teether it worked great 
5 5 my husband thinks it s adorable that he can see how her mouth works and getting the 2 package is the best idea learn now never buy one of a baby thing we keep one downstairs and one upstairs and in case of emergency we are always aware of where they are since one is pink and the other is purple no mix up of is this paci 1 or 2 great purchase arrived rapidly and thank goodness because mommy was beginning meltdown mode of baby not wanting anything 
5 5 my son loved this binky when he was a young baby because he was able to pick it up and bring it to his mouth before he mastered the pincher grisp now he loves it as an older baby because it doubles as a comfort toy 
5 5 item was delivered within a week my husband was a little hesitant about the purchase as he thought the stuffed animal would weigh on our little one s neck however it s very lightweight and charming we purchased the pink elephant 
5 5 easy to open for a mom with her hands full which is great compared to others 
5 5 excellent 
5 5 my baby loves this product it is easy for her hold and it doesn t get lost like her other pacifiers 
4 4 good quality my baby loves it i just wish the pacifier was detachable for cleaning purposes 
5 5 excellent product 
4 4 love the pacis but i wanted the ones that where displayed in the picture overall i like them 
5 3 these are the only binkys my stubborn baby will use and of course our first one was free with our carseat and she chose that over expensive others i had purchased so that has to say something after having these binkys since april the green yellow one developed mold on the inside and the design on the outside has worn off the upside is i emailed chicco and they have sent a replacement the key to this is be very careful how you clean them i recommend a binky sanitizing wipe and not immersing in water we love these and my child will continue using this brand until we ween her off them 
5 5 excellent
5 5 i gave this to my cute nephew and he loves it 
1 1 this feels like a knockoff not a soothie attached but a very similar looking pacifier the puppy is not a weighted stuffed animal like the others came in a plastic bag instead of the normal packaging will be returning once i can replace it with the real wubbas 
5 5 great 
5 4 i really like this pacifier well i should say my kids have loved these pacifiers my favorite thing about them is that each pacifier comes with a plastic snap on case which makes traveling with them so much easier what i don t like about them and other brands is that water can get trapped on the inside of the pacifier which just grosses me out that said i keep buying them because they are a favorite in this house 
5 5 our 6 month old loves this pacifier it is easy for him to hold and get back in his mouth it is easy for me to hold onto it when we are out and about too so it doesn t fall on the floor the plush is soft and nice i wash mine in the washing machine inside a lingerie bag these make a wonderful gift 
5 5 cute
5 5 my baby has loved these since he was a newborn he doesnt really use it as a pacifier more as a teething toy 
5 5 i ordered 2 my 7mo old loves them
5 5 my baby loves these this is the only kind of pacifier he will take 
5 4 our baby has been sleeping on this since we brought him home it s exactly what we needed and expected i wish it were a little more sturdy and now after 4 months there s a bit of a divot in the middle where the baby has been sleeping but for the price it has worked really well i suppose we are almost ready to transition to a crib anyway :(
5 5 good
5 4 none available 
5 3 wow just like the other reviews have stated this bed is like sleeping on a sheet of plywood there appears to be no difference between the baby side and the toddler side they are both as firm as a sidewalk 
1 1 i bought these bottle after reading the reviews in the gumdrop pacifiers these are horrible bottles every single one leaks like crazy at the bottom can t even try to use these buyer beware save your money and buy something better 
5 5 this suit worked it s magic on my 6 month old i highly recommend it every time we put it on him he knows it s bedtime it keeps him comfy cozy and he doest get hot in it and he is a hot baby and it s 109 degrees where we live we keep his room nice and cool with a fan
1 2 ordered this because the color seemed to be more what would fit with my daughters baby room than shermags in the baby stores like other people have said when it arrived the box was all beat up and torn open at places the box is not sturdy enough for ups shipping we opened it and it found the base was cracked and there was a dirt smudge on an arm cushion i called their customer service for replacement parts and they were very responsive only problem was that they were on summer vacation at warehouse and the replacement parts would not be shipped until after the item was needed to be a gift having said that it seemed to be an ok item that would be worth the money if it arrived undamaged sent it back to amazon for refund and as usual amazon was great so if you get one thats in one piece it looks to be an a pretty good chair which is much cheaper than similar items in the baby box stores 
5 5 perfect for infants transitioning off bottles 
5 5 great product i originally brought the blue whale by muchkin but every time i turned my faucet on it kept falling off i read the reviews on this product and decided to buy it you really have to push it on because it is a snug fit it fits perfect on my faucet because i have my shower switch higher i love this product going to get it for my other home 
1 2 at first the camera worked well but then began to fail the monitor works fine but the camera is not the problem is that i live in argentina and i bought during my vacation in miami what should i do i am very disappointed my country has restrictions on sending or receiving packages from abroad what shoud i do 
5 5 this was my lifesaver in the hospital when i hadn t yet learned how to swaddle with regular blankets looks super cute and keeps baby s arms in place my only complain was that it was too warm for summer for colder weather the thickness of the fabric would be an advantage though :)
5 5 kids loved it 
5 5 you only really need one of these highly recommend to keep your hands cool when handling these take the bottle out of the warmer wipe the excess water off and pop it in the sleeve 
5 5 the baby is 16 mos now and still likes the sounds even my 14 yr old cat likes it he naps with it 
5 5 i have no idea if this reduces my son s pain while teething it s not like he can tell me so himself but he drools a lot less when it is on tip for folks who feel weird about the choke hazard debate loop it twice and put around your little one s ankle problem solved 
5 5 even cuter in person high quality very huggable she sits up well on her own on a shelf too 
5 5 love love love this for my little guy these are the only pacis he likes nothing else works like these 
5 4 i wish the loop to hook it to a diaper bag was a closed loop but other than that it is awesome it has saved us from meltdowns from the binky being dropped on the floor and needing a replacement as well as helping to keep the diaper bag more organized 
5 5 the only one my little guy likes he loves them and can pick up and put in his mouth by himself 
5 1 blue ones arrived i wanted the ones for my grand daughter
1 1 worst baby item i have ever bought it is a total waste of money it is very hard to clean and after first use put banana inside it the cloth turned dark colour and i keep trying to clean all the banana pieces out and after 4 times of washing it like a crazy mad woman i still have pieces left i am not going to bother with it any more and since food can stick to it that means mold will form on it even if we can t see it if you were wondering i did wash it right away after first use which lasted few mins because of the mess that it was creating and the baby got frustrated trying to get the mashed banana out 
5 5 great item looks exactly like the picture 
4 4 my three month old daughter likes this pacifier love the cover that comes with it have given the product 4 stars since it is a little hard to clean but that is a minor gripe overall highly recommend this pacifier 
5 5 my 4 5 mo son loves the wubbanub i personally love cats so that s why i picked out this one i didn t like the red dog and yellow duck sold at babies r us i would recommend this to anyone 
5 4 my 2 month daughter only likes soothie pacifiers i recently gave her her wubanub and she seems to like this i like that the stuffed animal offers her something to hold and stays in place my only dislike is that the pacifier is attached so i can t cover it with a pacifier cover or thrown into sterilizer i just carry it around in a zip lock 
5 5 they really glow in the dark my son loves them 
5 5 excelente product
5 5 very soft and gummy like my daughter took a few days to like the shape but does well with it now :)
5 5 arrived safely
5 5 all good
5 5 excellent high quality product
5 5 the only pacifier my daughter took to similar to the 34 real thing 34 
1 2 it had a rip in it when it arrived baby could not use it 
5 5 great price thank you 
5 5 this little giraffe is just adorable i make sure this goes in the car with us it s much harder for my little guy to loose it during our travels the giraffe is soft and snugly perfect for little hands to hug 
5 5 i bought these to tell my lions fan husband he was going to be a father we had a girl but she still used them for the games :)
5 5 this is my number one recommendation for new moms 
5 5 my baby loves her wubbanub kitty 
5 5 my son always likes holding my finger when he sleeps but since we got this he holds it it s his best friend 
5 3 ordered for a little boy and we received pink and purple will be giving away as a gift to friends with a daughter 
5 5 these glow in the dark for many hours makes finding them when my son spits them out in the middle of the night very easy definitely recommend 
5 5 love it 
5 3 smaller and lighter then i expected 
5 5 fits two pacifiers easily well made product easy to clean and stylish this product always keeps your pacifiers readily available and easy to find a must have for your on the go diaper bag 
5 5 these things are great 
5 4 a little small
5 5 this has been the only binky that my daughter likes we have gotten all 3 stages of it so far and have been very happy with it they have stood up to many many cleanings without breaking down it is also large enough that choking is less of a concern the back also allows my daughter to grab the pacifier and also to easily attach a strap when she is in the stroller so it doesn t get lost 
5 2 they are nice and wet and also a good size only problem is the taste it leaves on the cleaned surface 
5 5 not sure why but these are the only paci s my son loves now that he is 7 months he can easily hold onto them because of the openings on the side this is key read he doesn t need mommy 24 7 
5 5 perfect
5 5 these make such a difference compared to pacifiers without the little stuffed animal on it the stuffed animal stays in place on your baby s chest so if the pacifier pops out of their mouth it doesn t go far and they can often find it again themselves it s terrific for self soothing and when we got this we had less interruptions in our sleep during the night 
5 1 it was too large for our son 
5 5 adorable 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my little one would take we had tried the soothies and she just couldn t hang on to them they kept popping out these are much easier for her to keep in she can soothe herself to sleep in the middle of the night now happy mama 
5 5 holds a tommee tippee pacie plus clip perfectly i can even squeeze another pacie if i wanted although that makes it a little tight really easy to clean i wipe it out or toss it in the wash also easy to open with one hand i was looking at the jujube holder and almost bought it instead of this one but i made the right choice my daughter was fussing the other day and i was able to hold her in one arm and grab her pacie with the other one less catastrophe makes a difference did i mention it s adorable 
5 5 the pacifier set was purchased as a gift and the mom to be absolutely loved it exactly as described and the words are very clear 
1 1 this has a proposition 65 warning this is the right for california residence to know if a product contains potentially cancerous causing material and chemicals do not buy i have contacted nuk and am currently waiting a reply to find out what could make it potentially cancer causing 
5 5 as described
5 5 adorable 
5 5 just like the ones from the hospital great buy 
5 5 baby approved 
5 1 i chose the blue bottles that had the monkeys on them but i received the ones with airplanes one them i wanted to get the ones i ordered 
5 5 great
5 5 my daughter loves these there the only pacifer she will take 
5 5 i wish i found these sooner 
5 5 as sold in shops the visible darkness rim is a selling point 
5 5 we love all our wubbanubs we throw 4 in my 8 month old s crib every night so he can find them when he needs them he learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my son will accept he can keep hold of them with much ease and they are shaped more natural
5 5 we love these they were life savers during sleep training because my baby learned to put them in his mouth himself before he could easily get a plain pacifier in himself so once he learned we started leaving 4 in the crib every night so he can find them throughout the night and get back to sleep without our help also good for the car because he can easily find them without help 
5 5 work great
5 5 the only pacifiers that my son would suck love them they are very light weight unlike other competitors out there
3 3 i ordered the pink one for my baby niece the problem was i received the black and white ones which i guess its ok since its still raiders but i really hope they look and verify what was ordered to make sure customer gets what they are expecting 
5 5 adorable
5 4 simple and very useful we just have it attached to the arm of the stroller and it s always held tight and keeps the pacifiers clean and in reach holds about 2 pacifiers 3 if you cram it niced quality 
5 5 love these way cheaper than buying at the store 
5 5 perfect product to keep the pacifier clean at all times
5 2 i got these for my newborn she weighed about 6 pounds at birth so i was hoping these were on the small side at 0 3 months but they were too big for her
5 5 my 8 month old loves these they are good as teethers too 
5 5 wubbanub pacifiers are the best they make a parents life so much easier they make the pacifier easier to find in the dark or under the crib once your baby has more motor skills she will be able to put the pacifier back in her mouth easier than just a regular one the wubbanub is positionable so it can be laid on the babies chest perfect for the car seat too or propped up when your baby starts sleeping on her side it s soft and cute my baby likes to stroke it as she is falling asleep i throw them in the wash and let them air dry they ve lasted through two kids no problemseach animal can be used differently the duck is good for laying on the chest the caterpillar is perfect for the carseat i like the red dog best it s really easy to position 
5 5 of the three wubbas i have purchased paci eating dog the elephant is the best it s ears are easy for a baby to grasp 
5 4 too cute my newborn loves her bunny 
1 3 this pacifiers won t stay in my child s mouth very disappointed i will not purchase this again
5 5 they are great
5 5 for a shower haven t given them yet
5 5 about the size of a small womens hand perfect for first my essential oil first aid kit you could probably fit two ish handfuls of cheerios in here if that helps too 
5 4 wubbanubs are a great way to keep track of soothies and even my newborn can grip into the little tiger paws to keep it held right the biggest down side to this particular wubbanub is that the tiger s paws brush the baby s cheek when they re sucking on the soothie which often triggers the rooting reflex that means the baby stops sucking on the soothie in hopes of something better which with a young baby means you ll be helping the soothie back into baby s mouth the quality of the item is top notch we ve purchased many wubbanubs for my kids and they re all quality but i think the design could be improved just by changing the angle of the front paws a bit 
5 5 we love all our wubbanubs we throw 4 in my 8 month old s crib every night so he can find them when he needs them he learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in 
5 5 the only bottles my baby will take also i could find these for a better price at winco foods they cost 8 00 each at burlington coat factory they cost 13 00 a pair and here 18 00 for 4 plus 2 pacifiers best offer
1 1 for whatever reason of the four yellow soothies i have purchased two had holes in the tips which made them unusable i have not had this trouble with green or blue soothies 
5 4 good quality and easy to use love this product 
5 5 these are wonderful for allowing both parent and baby to find the paci during the middle of the night highly recommend 
5 5 my baby loves it 
3 3 it s cute but as my 1 year old is used to nuk this did not appeal to him the shape is similar but is longer and more narrow than nuk 
3 3 these are really cute but my son doesn t like them he would rather chew on the mustache rubber than the pacifier we don t use them anymore 
5 5 great 
5 5 my son love these specifiers they seem to sue than him
3 4 nice but the packaging was popped open
4 4 oh my gosh baby loves this the only drawback is that the pacifier does not detach from the stuffy i would much rather it be two separate pieces so that i could sanitize the paci but all in all its still a good product 
5 5 fun gift for my daughter :)
5 5 great for kids soothing i will recommend to new moms specially for babies this is great for the middle of the night so you won t have to be searching for the pacifier in the dark this will hold and stay in
5 2 my breastfed baby won t take it i wish she would i really like the look and style if paci
5 5 these work well they are the only brand my daughter will keep in her mouth 
5 5 she is officially addicted
5 5 my daughter loves her bear we also got her the dragon because who doesn t love got she likes both i m sure we ll get more soon the quality is great pacifiers are sewn on good and animals are soft 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my baby will take even though she s 7 weeks they calm her down pretty well too 
1 2 the idea behind this item is great but the execution is not the pacifier used is not the same quality as if purchased by itself less durable softer it is also not detachable therfore you can t replace it or sanitize it you have to wash it by hand or in the washing machine which will degrade the material i also don t like that they used sand small filler think 34 beanie babies 34 in the feet as weights to me this poses a safety issue repeated washing and babies chewing sucking can be hard on things and the only thing separating this choking hazard is the stitching since my son likes to suck on the feet i don t give it to him unless i am there to watch closely ;)
5 3 bottles leak 
5 4 we received this as a gift from our baby registry pros you can choose time settings 30 45 or 60 minutes i use the 30 minutes because the bottles are usually dry in about 10 the sterilizing takes about 8 minutes it is really easy to use and looks nice on our kitchen counter it fits 6 bottles and parts at one time a major problem is that it leaks alot after we turn it on our kitchen counter always has a large puddle of water leaking from the sterilizer we have tried putting less water and making sure we don t go above the max fill line however it still leaks it is annoying because it leaves water makes all over our countertop leaking aside we tried the advent sterilizer which doesnt dry the bottles and decided to keep the brezza because the drying option is so convenient and makes it easy to just take the bottles out and not have to dry them separately 
5 5 this was a gift for the only baby boy in our family and it is adorable love it and so does his mama 
5 5 too cute 
5 5 purchased this cute little paci for my granddaughter cutest thing ever besides my granddaughter definitely a must have for those cute babies the seller provided a great price and fast shipping 
5 2 my baby does like this at all he doesn t like the soothie pacifier at all 
5 5 this mam gift set is nice we don t use the binky but these bottles are great there are 2 smaller bottles with size 1 nipples and 2 larger bottle with size 2 nipples the only issue i have with mam bottles is when warming he milk it tends to leak so we now have to use a different bottle to warm the milk and transfer it to these bottles the baby likes it so we are happy 
5 5 baby starting to adjust to it i like it it s ok 
5 5 this worked great for my son always on hand doesn t fall when he spits it out it s completely adorable 
5 5 my babies love their wubbanubs sometimes they aren t even interested in the pacifier part they just like the stuffed animal 
5 5 exactly what i expected 
5 5 very nice
5 5 my grandaughter can t get enough of these pacifiers she loves carrying them with a foot in her mouth so her hands are free they hold up well to daily washing it s her go to toy when ready for bed 
5 5 this fits just right in my newborns mouth the suction on the nipple works great in my babies mount this will help reduce overeating as well as crying clear and bp free
5 5 my son loves these pacifiers since he was a newborn they are easy to clean 
5 5 very good 
5 5 i have six of these things they re wonderful because they re easy for babies to find in the night if they re dropped ensuring that they don t wake up as often and because of their size i have only ever lost one they started selling them at babies r us recently but they don t seem to be made of the same quality so i only buy the special edition ones this one is so soft we also have the caterpillar perfect for newborns tiny hands two dog and a cats one of the cat ones is from when they first came out in 2011 and one is a more recent one the newer one is smaller in size and not nearly as soft 
5 5 every baby needs one 
5 5 excelent my baby love it
1 1 its smaller than i expected my son uses soothie pacifier but hates this and won t take it its an over priced item that is more for moms to collect than a practical useful item i feel like i wasted money 
5 5 a erect combination of pacifier and soft cuddly toy the lamb s leg is great for holding in the mouth so to free up the hands for crawling holds up great for regular washings 
5 5 i love this bag can fit three pacifiers in it
5 3 wanted to love this but it seemed too short to stay in my newborns mouth so it just kept falling out 
5 2 it came in a little cheap plastic bag i wanted to add this to gift basket but i feel like it looks used in that little cheap bag
1 1 sooooooooo hard to open and then the kiddo just liked to rub his feeder on the ground i got this thinking the holes would be better than the silicone style hard to get stuff out of that but even if my baby had liked this it wasn t worth the hand strain trying to open and close 
5 5 my granddaughter absolutely loved this i wish they would have had something like this when i had my kid i would for sure recommend this product for babies 
5 4 works as expected
5 4 this worked great for a teething baby filled the medicine part with water and froze when my grandson used it it was cold on his gums and he got a drink of cold water at the same time 
5 1 it arrived in a plain unlabeled plastic bag has really strong plastic smell and it became cloudy after sterilized highly doubt it s bpa free i had to throw it right away didn t even let my lo try it don t feel this product is safe to use 
5 5 as advertised
5 4 her favorite toy pacifier great when dirty i just throw it in the wash 
5 5 at first i have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose flexible rigid small or big i went through pages and reviews and got more confused some of them look fashion but i really worried about whether they are practical for me after all it is just a diaper bag i asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old she told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin that is the most important soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry she really have the point this bag is big and light enough for me there are some points that i like about it it doesn t have too complex compartments inside which i like it is easy for me to put things in and take out the fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage the material is good quality it doesn t have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff it has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper that is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk you need it immediately most of the time it surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag i use it to hold dirty or wet clothes very thoughtful list of things i bring for a day out in case you need to know a double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached change of clothes diaper for two child medicine like vitamins paper handkerchief talc first aid kit pacifiers milk and two bottles my wallet book i love to read in the park 
5 2 these are the only passy s my daughter will take the description says 2 pack insinuating that are 2 packs each pack containing 2 passy s expected 4 total and it only came with 2 these are usually 5 99 for a pack of two so they charged double not happy 
3 3 it is a clever pacifier but there is a down side it closes just right however baby cannot open it so it is useless if you dont have to worru about droped pacifier getting dirty you have to open the cover for baby mom of 9month old girl
5 5 as described arrived on time no damage no issues 
5 3 it s cute but actually makes it easier for my son to loose his pacifier he grabs onto the monkey and pulls it out all the time hes 3 months may work better once hes older and can use it to hold onto we will see 
5 5 gave as a baby shower gift daddy was ecstatic all the bears fans present were miffed and we ll hear from the baby in the next few weeks you can find just about anything on amazon com awesome 
5 1 none available 
4 4 my son loves this nuk however it gets pretty gross inside the rubber thingy you can clean it but its not easy 
5 5 shipped fast very pleased with purchase 
1 1 i bought this mainly for the drying feature disappointed to smell a gross toxic plastic chemically smell every time it dried it made the inside of the bottles smell this way too for quite a while which made me just feel like there were little particles of chemicals or plastic that must have been stuck to the inside of the bottles tried running it a few times to see if it was just because it was new but the smell still stayed the same so i returned it if it wasn t for the smell i would have liked the product 
5 5 she loves her binky 
5 5 absolutely awesome plush soft permanebtly attached pacifier as you can see in my attached picture you can wrap their little arms and hands around the bear to hold toghtly in place stays in the cuddly caress of her embrace as she falls to sleep quietly suckling her 34 bobo 34 great invention just clean with soap and water thought it would be weird thats its permanently attached but no it works perfectly 
1 2 i like wubbanub but this gray color is worst in reality than in the pictures quickly sent back 
5 5 way better than the traditional pacy s
5 4 my son loves it
5 4 this is great except that our son likes to move his head around a lot and the pacifier doesn t move with him it s very cute though and he loves to play with it 
5 5 the one pacifier my granddaughter would take yay 
5 5 these pacifiers are the best 
5 5 my baby loves mam air pacifiers and i love that it helps keep the area around his mouth dry especially now that he drools more 
5 4 good product
5 5 cutest binkys i ve ever purchased my daughter loves them and all mam products deff reccomend these 
5 5 can t wait to see them on my grandson 
5 5 it s soft and the perfect size for my son to hold he loves it and it helps him sleep great snuggle size too when he s not using the passie :)
5 5 my daughter in law is nursing and says this pacifier is most like 34 mom 34 so my grand daughter is willing to use it 
4 4 my son will only take this type of pacifier so we are happy to have purchased them however even though the showed pretty neutral colors for the the multicolor option we got pink and yellow for a boy not complaining about the product just the fact that the pictures do not actually represent what is sent 
5 5 ordered for my grandson and he loves it 
5 5 i searched through hundreds of bags online and in the stores and this is just the bag i have been looking for it is very nice has a cute color scheme and is spacious yet lightweight it comes with all of the essentials inside i am going to order a second one as a back up 
5 5 my son loved it
5 5 my son uses this brand bottles and one of the bottle packs came with a free i had to go buy them this is the fourth type of passafire i have tried with him plus i love them because they come in such cute designs
1 1 this is such a rip off i have 0 3 month pacifier from the same company and they are exactly the same baby doesn t use any of them 
5 5 this puppy is so adorable my little 3 month old can t consistently and steadily hold his soothie pacifier with his hand but he has no problems holding the puppy and helping the pacifier stay in place soothie is his favorite pacifier so it s really nice to have this little product 
5 5 my son loves this monkey it doesn t fully function as it should but he still gets a kick out of it the chords that the pacifiers attach to are too short my baby can barely get one of the pacifiers in his mouth so it s difficult for him to suck on i can understand why the chords are short they don t want it to be a strangling hazard despite this my son still loves looking at the monkey in his car seat he ll 34 bat 34 at the chords and chew on the sides the monkey stays in place unlike his other toys on hooks that just slide around 
5 5 my daughter loves her wubbanub so much so that we have had to buy spares super cute just wish she hadn t gotten attached to one of the most expensive ones lol
5 5 love these pacifiers i only wish i could get my baby to stop taking a pacifier but the sport theme is nice for a boy 
1 2 while i love mam pacifiers they re the only one s my son will take i was not satisfied with this set the pattern on the pacifier is not the one i received i did receive a 34 monster collection 34 set but they are dinosaurs in the image carousel at the top of the page dinosaurs are not shown at all i feel that this is a misrepresentation of the product by the seller i returned them 
1 1 the pink smoothie has a hole in it it s very troubling since the package was closed 
5 5 our baby loves this pacifier she won t take any other kind we ve been trying to transition her to the 6 18 month pacifiers but they seem too big for her mouth so we re sticking with these 34 baby 34 ones for now 
5 4 it s hard to review these because our infant never actually learned to take a pacifier what i can say is that they are of great quality and came well packed 
5 5 my baby has been using this since she was 2 weeks old and she likes them much better than any other pacifiers we got for our baby shower in fact i only got these because she would spit out everything we had i guess these are closer to the shape of the nipples or something i haven t tried but my daughter now 2 5 months likes them :)
5 5 my daughter absolutely loves these pacifiers we were hard set on switching her to pacifiers vs her thumb and these were a huge hit i received the product as pictured and they are super cute i would definitely buy them again or recommend them 
5 5 nice
5 5 love this 
3 3 i wanted to love these because of the hygienic aspect but something about them my son hates possibly the feel or the nipple shape it seems smaller than his nuk brand which he seems to prefer 
5 5 good 
5 5 wubbanubs make it so easy to find a paci both of my babies loved them 
5 5 excellent pacifier for baby she was very entertaining and it has very good quality 
5 5 good
5 5 my son is ebf and he loves his mam binkies i love that i can find the glow in the dark ones easily at night 
5 5 great alternative
3 4 a little smaller then i had expected should be able to fit a few wipes in there but not a diaper i bought for the print which is absolutely adorable 
5 5 this little pouch is a life saver it easily fits 2 pacifiers with space to spare it s so convenient not having to search through the diaper bag to find a pacifier i also love the snap that is used to secure this pouch it s much more secure than using velcro like other similar products use con the loop to snap this pouch is a little small you can t snap this on the car seat handle but it does fit well on a purse or diaper bag 
5 5 can t wait to see these in action lol love them
5 5 great for finding the paci while you are sleep walking into your son s room they really do glow in the dark 
4 4 love the color love avent wish it had a lid cap or holder however 
1 3 my baby did not like these but they re not expensive so not a big loss 
5 5 the best pacifiers 
5 5 it s so cute
5 4 i bought this for my micro preemie niece she loves it she is able to hold onto it or grab it easily when she wants it she has even offered it to her twin when she is crying even though she has one of her own 
5 5 does it s job 
5 5 handy for little fingers and so mommy doesnt loose it
5 5 can t leave home without our 34 puppy 34 
5 5 baby loves it
5 5 this is hilarious my niece loved it at her baby shower 
5 5 my son loved this 
4 2 this is smaller than i thought it would be
5 5 wubbanub are amazing easy to stay in baby mouth an easy to keep up with with my first i had to buy so many binks from her losing them best invention ever an o so cute we have this one a caterpillar and a monkey
5 5 very good thank you
5 5 my baby loves these and the monkey shape works the best with its longer curved forearms 
5 5 the only paci my 1 month old babies can kind of keep in their mouths for more than 2 seconds and it s natural win 
5 5 this bag is the perfect size i was a bit concerned when i saw it was drawstring but i haven t had any problems i just toss it in my diaper bag and throw anything that gets messy in it until i get back home 
5 5 best sterilizer i have purchased i had a cheaper one because i did not want to soend too much big mistake this sterilizer cleans well and dried leaving behind no odors or moisture i highly recommend this product 
5 5 love love love this product a must have for paci lovers this is the second one i have purchased the first one we purchased was the pink elephant it was helpful because our newborn kept spitting her paci out and then would get mad we have found that with this product she has an easier time getting it back in her mouth and keeping it there she also loves to grab a hold of them it is nice be cause she was already used to this type of paci since this is the one they give you in the hospital also you don t loose them as easily as a regular paci plus they are just so cute i definitely would get these as a shower gift it is one of those things no one would think to get even though it s handy to have 
5 5 great buy
5 5 perfect
5 5 covers are everything easy to take these on the go 
5 1 my daughter hated it she wouldnt take it 
5 5 awesome for infants they are easily able to find the paci and put it back in themselves 
3 2 it s ridiculous you can t pick the color you want but whatever i still use them 
5 5 mam brand is what was preferred by all three of my babies these pink newborn ones are both adorable and perfectly sized 
5 5 excellent 
3 3 was okay for a small shower 
5 5 my twins love these they were very early so they took a bit to get good enough hand control to grab their pacifiers with these they were able to hang on to the animals with their arms these are in many of their pictures because they love love love them 
5 5 awesome
5 5 my twins love these they were very early so they took a bit to get good enough hand control to grab their pacifiers with these they were able to hang on to the animals with their arms these are in many of their pictures because they love love love them 
5 1 this pacifier looks great from the front but the built in case cover that it has is extremely annoying it prevents baby from being able to suckle the pacifier in the usual way and as soon as the pacifier comes out of baby s mouth the cover automatically snaps back into place around the mouthpiece of the pacifier this means that baby can t put the pacifier back in her own mouth parents have to do it trendy item but not practical at all noting that my experience is based on 4 children over the past 8 years so i ve literally purchased over 100 pacifiers in that time 
5 5 i use it for my butt everyday
5 5 the safest pacifiers i could find worth trying 
1 2 disappointed because i have received the wrong pacifier it is not an easy process to receive the correct one i have to request a refund return print it out mail it back and then reorder my pacifier again with the hopes that it will be correct this time 
5 2 not worth the price should have at list been made in way that the pacifier cut out and have a way of sticking it on the game 
5 5 i ve read that these don t cause nipple confusion for an ebf baby we waited a month before introducing artificial nipples and this seems to hold true i also like that they are all one piece and easy to clean 
5 5 kiddo loves this thing to pieces somecomments the pacifier is not removable so you can t pop one out and pop in a clean one i kind of wish it was a clamp or something that held in the paci so i could more easily clean it when i m on the go we had to contact customer service at wubbanub because the stitching on the giraffe ear is coming undone they were very helpful and are sending a replacement
5 5 my son love wubbanub pacifiers i have three but he seems to prefer his giraffes he is nine months old and he is able to find his pacifier when he loses it in his sleep in his crib pretty quickly 
5 5 the kid loves it 9 months old non latex perfect for us since my husband as bad topical latex allergy 
5 5 perfect soother for newborn i just wish avent would package more pacifiers with more than 1 color i like having multiple colors so i know how many have gone missing both from this purchase are already lost 
5 5 excellent product good seller highly recommended 
5 5 the monkey wubbanub is perfect can t wait till my 11 2 month son starts grasping things this for sure will be a hit im tired of losing his pacifiers this was worth the buy update we eventually lost this pacifier in the parking lot of clackamas or costco and i tell you whoever finds this lil guy will be a happy camper i am really sad he s gone my 4 month old has a duck penguin and elephant in his wubbanub entourage but the monkey was definitely one of his favorite as the body is longer and has more substance for support when laying him to sleep on his side these make for great baby shower gifts and hold up really well in the washer to my surprise 
5 3 is an excellent product i have used it with my oldest two children but this time one of the binkies has a hole in the nipple making it impossible for my son to use the pacifier very disappointing 
5 5 awww suck ephant i miss you my son threw this beauty out of his stroller near the southermost point in key west and his momma didn t notice good thing we had suck dog suck frog and suck asaurus to fall back on these are the best the elephant was my favorite 
5 5 my niece loves it 
5 2 i bought these for my one year old daughter because i had read that they did a great job of mimicking the natural movement and softness of a real nipple because they stretch she is a night nurser and i m trying to get her to stop using my breasts as a pacifier they looked nice when we got them so i let her try one she sucked for a few seconds and then threw it across the room every time i put it in her mouth she d do the same thing i thought i d try sucking on one to see what it felt like for her and immediately my top lip was pinched between the hard plastic outer piece and the soft silicone no wonder she didn t want to suck it hurts the other one did the same i also noticed that the nipple has a very apparent and somewhat scratchy seam around it i can t imagine that feeling very natural for a baby overall we were disappointed 
5 5 only pacifier my baby will use 
5 5 loved it only paci baby would take and super cute love that toy prevents paci from getting lost and touching the ground less likely 
4 2 they re good pacifiers the only thing it doesn t glow at all that why i received 2 stars 
5 5 before my dog chewed the this up my daughter loved it she doesn t take this type of pacifier as we started her on a different one at birth but she still loved to play with it thank you :(
5 5 my baby loves this thing great product without the plastic
5 5 great
5 3 doesn t hold its glow throughout the night which defeats the purpose but it helped my son find where his 34 paci cup 34 is in the dark no more late night wakes
5 4 i am wishing we discovered these sooner my son won t hold a pacifier in his mouth it immediately falls out while he is sucking and that makes one angry baby these pacifiers are the smooth shape recommended for breast fed babies which our boy is and they have the added weight of the stuffed animal to prevent the baby from shooting the pacifier out of his mouth things to think about or things that the wife doesn t like you can t boil the pacifier because the stuffed animal doesn t detach you can t boil to sanitize and if something gets on the stuffed animal you have to wash the entire thing in the washing machine and then re clean the pacifier to make sure all of the detergent is off of the pacifier 
5 3  
5 1 its really hard to open and close and it s made of crappy materials just use a ziploc 
5 5 expensive after i purchased that i found one same one much cheap
3 5 they work and the wipes are big but not too big 
4 4 only reason i m giving it four instead of five is because it s a 34 one time deal 34 plug pacifier for the price they should make them to have replaceable plugs overall after trying five different kinds of plugs my son finally took this one i m not normally a fan of them but i ebf and i could use a break from the comfort nursing some days 
5 5 excellent product definitely i recommend this pacifier 
3 3 good idea to keep it clean when in use but paradoxically impossible to sterilize in boiling water my baby didn t like the contact with his face and mouth as he sucks it 
5 5 my dolly could not live without her wubbanub we have a few designs and this is a favorite of hers she loves to rub the tail as an additional comfort oh and it s super cute too 
5 5 got what i asked for byt my son didn t take to it he prefers a different shaped teat
5 5 very nice
5 5 only pacifiers my baby uses this are the best also they when it was time it was easy to break the habit of use 
5 5 best pacifier for breastfed babies i purchase mam bottles and thought i give these a try 
5 5 we had a blast seeing our son use this pacifier he doesn t take a pacifier very long usually but it kept this one long enough to give us a few laughs and great pics 
5 4 daughter doesn t like any other type i just hate how water and saliva can get inside the silicone part 
4 4 this is great but wish it was removable to wash the pacifier 
5 5 the whole world is in peace
5 5 our dd is no longer using pacifiers but this is the one i recommend and will always use for future kiddos interestingly the nature of this pacifier lended itself to our daughter weaning off the pacifier a little after 12 months she had had her last pacifier long enough to colapse the bulb flat and since it didn t seem she was ready to give it up i decided i better replace it apparently she didn t like the new and preferred the old deflated pacifier better so after playing around and chewing on it for a week or two i hid it and she forgot about it 
5 5 baby loves it 
5 2 unlike other wubbanubs the roundness of this animal shape means it tends to roll off my baby i d recommend other animals like the puppy over this one 
5 5 super cute works great 
5 4 silicon is almost too soft afraid that my baby who likes to chew on his pacifiers will get it stuck in his mouth while cheering on it 
5 5 these really stay in my baby s mouth when he stops sucking and prevents the nightime wakeup we were struggling with he still can spit it out amd does fall out if he dozed in a more upright position i think he prefers the feel of the soothe over this pacifier but it s been a great way for all of us to get more sleep 
5 5 these are super soothies 3 months 
5 5 my grandsons like their new pacifiers thanks
4 3 i expected to receive pink pacifiers based on pictures and other reviews but no i got blue ones i give 3 stars because you can t pick a color 
5 5 these are amazing my baby loves this brand the style everything they re easy to clean and find because of their colors highly reccommend 
1 1 i ordered these months ago and they were the only pacifiers my daughter liked i ordered more and when i opened them i saw a whole in one of the pacifiers the other ones look they are prone to the same defect because there is a weak spot at the seam in the front part of the nipple 
5 5 super cute works great 
5 5 the vanilla scented pacifier are the best 
5 5 my infant loves this and it stays in his mouth perfectly 
5 5 great pacifier
5 5 great product 
5 4 these are so nice makes find the pacifier easy also easier if you have reach back in car seat to give back to baby kids love it as a lovie too 
5 4 we have twins and they love their wubbanubs we have many different versions kitty cat bear frog etc but the dog is the absolute favorite and we must have 2 available at all times this will be the 4th or possible 5th dog wubbanub we have purchased i m not sure if it s because he s their favorite or something about the design of this one but the silicone tab that connects the stuffed dog to the pacifier starts tearing much faster than any of the other versions we own and must be replaced more often i can t wait until we are done with pacifiers so i don t have to replaced them anymore but until then the brown puppy is our twins bink of choice 
5 5 freaky fun great product 
5 4 these are the only binkies my daughter will use and she loves them
5 5 awesome product 
5 4 could these pacifiers be any cuter purchased these for a friend who is expecting and she absolutely loved them my only disappointment is that the packaging could be better came in a small plastic bag nevertheless it s a perfect choice if your looking for a good laugh :)
5 5 natural baby likes the item
5 2 my breastfed baby loves these and we have ordered two pairs from amazon and purchased one from walgreens one out of each package had a hole in the paci causing my son to suck in air so out of the 6 we purchased we are left with 2 i am now on the quest looking for another paci we can t even return because i just threw them away 
5 5 this little thing is cute and holds pacifiers well my son doesn t use them very often but it is nice to have them nearby and clean when we do need them 
5 5 my little guy loves this really teaches him how to hold it in his mouth
5 4 great pacifier i am comfortable knowing that the chances of my child choking on this are practically null since it is all one solid piece of rubber and my baby loves it only reason i m giving it four sta rs is cuz this size is only for very young babies my son is not yet six weeks old and i think we ll b switching over to the bigger size soon but hey the price ain t bad so all in all its a great deal 
5 5 is the only type of pacifier that my daughter wants she refused all the silicone pacifiers and this it was our last chance fortunately it worked 
5 4 my son isn t much of a pacifier user but i do like these ones when he does take a paci we use these or mam we have one other pair that have little caps that clip on which i like but these are nice ones that have a natural shape 
5 5 these come in handy when u want to clean pacifiers and bottle nipples and u are not near a water source 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my daughter will take 
5 5 this fits comfortably in my baby s mouth and it s easy to find in the dark 
3 3 cute gift but unfortunately the item sent was different than the description and what is pictured ordered the brown ladies man twice and received the gentleman in black twice 
5 5 my son loves this much easier for baby to grasp than just a pacifier and it can go in the sterilizer which is great 
5 5 this wubbanubb is an absolutely adorable frog my son is 8 weeks old and loves it already i just got the order today by ups he has a puppy wubbanubb and will be getting more soon these are perfect for babies and the animal attached to it is small enough for little hands to hold onto if they choose a friend of mine said that these can be washed in the machine and dried on low as needed without ruining any of the pacifier or animal 
5 5 my baby loves these pacifiers they are safe and everyone always asks where we got them i had previously used the gerber kind with the blue pink or white plastic piece those were the only kind she would use but she only wanted the larger size and apparently they stopped making those so i went on a hint for a replacement and these worked like a charm 
1 3 i have a little boy and when i received these they were not the ones in the picture they are both pink just be fore warned now i m unsure what i want to do with them and still haven t opened them
5 3 about what i expected holds two pacifiers if you put them in a certain way 
5 5 love these binkies they are more durable then the newborn ones i used them with all of my children it is the only binky they will take thank you so much for the fast and speedy service 
5 5 only brand i buy
5 5 the kid loves these wubbanubs we love them because they re not easily lost 
5 5 best thing since sliced bread
5 4 adorable not sure how well it will work yet 
5 5 my little one was originally attached to the gerber pacifiers with the blue pink or white plastic piece but she only liked the larger size they stopped making those after she became attached so i had to find a replacement these did the trick she loves these and they feel safe 
5 1 love these but one pacifier has hole in it
5 5 great
5 5 the only passed by that my son loves
5 3 my baby will take just about any pacifier except for this it s probalbly a matter of preference though 
5 3 many moms have recommended the mam pacifiers to me for each of my kids being a soothe follower i was hesitant my cluster feeding 7mo finally convinced me to give it a go to try and give my nip a break at night these glow in the dark and are made in one piece a great design my lo just isn t a pacifier kinda kid so sadly these just sit in their case that you can use to sterlize the pacifiers in neato 
5 5 my little one loves it and has been using it since 2 1 2 months old now at 5 months it is our go to for nap time very easy to wash by hand or throw in the laundry and seems to be holding up so far despite heavy every day use 
5 5 i love how these pacifiers glow in the dark my baby isn t huge into pacifiers so it wasn t a huge help but at least she was able to get it at night in her crib without a light on 
5 5  :)
5 5 easy to find in the dark cute and the only pacifier my baby will take 
5 5 my babies would only take the binkies we got at the hospital these were just like them so they were perfect 
5 5 won t buy any brand but mam my son loves them love the glow in the dark feature as it makes it easy to find during the middle of the night or during the day if it has fallen under the crib 
5 5 i tried every single brand of pacifier for baby and wouldn t take to any but these these were the winner 
5 4 i think the concept is great my little one rarely takes a paci but does like to play with it it s easy for little hands to hold on to and easy to find in the crib if they lose it it s great for little ones who use paci s 
5 5 very cute arrived promptly 
5 5 the only brand my baby will take 
3 3 my son hates these he prefers the mam which is a completely different 34 type 34 of pacifier i would give a 1 star but that s not fair as my sons preference for mam doesn t mean your child won t like these mam is also nice because it comes with a sterilization case 
4 4 nice and the baby likes it i d give it 5 stars if the pullypalz came with the actual pacifier binkie four stars since you have to go out and buy it yourself 
5 5 very cute 
5 5 my son loves his wubbanuba s the zebra is one of his favorites he has been using them since he was about 6 weeks old and very quickly started grabbing on the animal he learned how to put it in his mouth pretty early as well because it s so easy to grab onto the toy he also loves chewing sucking on the legs just as much as the pacifier itself 
5 1 i am super frustrated with these pacifiers its a gimic they look exactly the same size as the 0 3 month pacies need to return 
5 5 excellent quality highly recommended as the best choice for toddlers tried tested over 3 children so far soon to be 4 
5 5 keeps your baby s binky clean 
5 5 we haven t used these yet but the quality of this pacifier is great fingers crossed our little guy loves them 
5 5 adorable 
5 5 with having animals in the house hair is everywhere i purchased this to keep his pacifiers hair free while in his diaper bag 
5 5 fits up to 3 pacifiers that was a shocker 
5 5 this is my go to pacifier i have had 4 kids and tried many different pacifiers but this one has always proven true to being a great product it lasts unless you have a cheer my last daughter is a chewer i bought these in stock because she would teeth so hard through them but it is a great product none of my children took any other kind of pacifier as great as they did this one 
5 5 i bought this for my son and he loves his wubbanub we don t go anywhere without it it makes it much easier for him to hold his pacifier in before we got this he didn t quite know how to hold those soothie pacifiers in his mouth they would fall on the floor a lot and bounce roll off under the couch or other pieces of furniture then we would have to spend a few minutes just to find it this wubbanub is perfect for keeping the paci in one place if he does happen to drop it which doesn t happen as often anymore they are easy to clean i just throw his in the washer and it comes out like new the i lay it on a flat surface to dry 
5 5 this is so adorable 
5 5 my 5 month old will only take this kind of binky i can only find the green ones and pink and purple ones in store so i was super excited when i found this color 
5 5 my daughter preferred these pacifiers over the others we gave her they re also great because she can chew on them while teething 
4 4 for a little while these pacifiers were the only ones that would stay in my baby s mouth we re glad that one came with the chicco keyfit 30 car seat that we bought after about 4 months though these no longer stayed in as well probably because our baby s mouth shape or preference changed it worked well for a time though 
5 5 the only pacifier our little guy would take perfect because it would rest on his tummy and help hold it in place 
5 5 these are good pacifiers my baby is iffy about taking a paci sometimes she hates them and sometimes she needs one to help calm her down of the several different brands of pacifiers we bought her this is the one that tends to soothe her the best and she sucks on the longest as a parent i like that i can just pop it in her mouth in either way because of the shape of the nipple there is no correct up or down which makes it easier to return to baby in a hurry after she knocks it out before she can start crying i also like the colors the white pacifier is actually clear the only part that is white is the middle nub 
5 5 i love this pacifier my baby was using the soothie pacifiers including the wubbanub with a plush doll at the end but this stays much better in her mouth it still falls out of her mouth when she falls asleep but a lot less frequently than the soothies 
5 5 everything was excellent 
5 1 the wubbanub s were new and as described but the package deal was to receive 3 and i only received 2 i contacted seller and never heard back anything very disapointed i always buy these for baby gifts for people since i know my son loved them but i will not be buying from this seller anymore 
5 5 great way to keep your baby s binky clean 
5 1 product stated as multicolor not mentioning any particular gender received it and found out that one of them was pink i ve checked and seen these comment before definitely would suggest to avoid them i have a boy so theres no use for it 
5 3 sticks well to my shower wall and i can move it wherever i need it 
5 5 citystroll 2 in 1 stroller organizer caddyi have a daycare and use a 4 top stroller which this fit without a problem this is such a handy thing to have with kids it holds a pkg of wipes my cell phone and a bottle this organizer also comes with a lift out caddy that has a long shoulder strap so it can be worn over the shoulder like a purse this was a great find and a great purchase it has been very handy with little ones on the go i received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review regardless the opinions found herein are based on my experiences with the product
5 5 must have with new baby
5 4 big for newborns size said 0 3 online but box it came in said 3mos i still think it worked some just a tad too large for my kids
5 5 great storage set for the price i purchased two of them for double the storage and it worked out great it just makes my sons room look so much cuter and it holds a lot 
5 5 this very durable and comfortable my kid love it weve been using is for awhile and never have problems easy to detached if i need to wash the cover 
5 5 the grandkid s love their sandbox and the seats close to cover the sand when not in use 
1 1 can t put too much without it actually tipping everything out of its units poorly made not really stable 
5 5 i love this every at my disposal and arms have cushioning 
5 5 got this for 11 month old grandson who s teething he was constantly drooling in no time drooling has stopped it s unbelievable how well it has worked grandson touched it when i put it on and hasn t touched it since absolutely love it thanks 
5 5 i love these formula dispensers super useful i use them to store formula pacifiers bottle caps and other random things that my baby needs while i m out and about works well with dry items never tried with wet foods you can take as many compartments as you need i love how each compartment can be opened with or without the spout which makes putting formula into the dispenser just as easy as emptying it out without leaving any formula stuck inside the container 
5 5 my son loves it
5 5 very strong 
5 5 everything was excellent 
5 5 true the glow in the dark part usually fades by early morning but i would still buy these again these are one of the few pacifiers that my daughter uses without the handle it s harder for her to pull out of her mouth which i like 
5 5 i am very pleased that i got exactly what i ordered not badly priced and very fast delivery definitely be ordering again 
5 5 my baby can easily hold on to this pasifier it doesnt get dropped as much as one that s not attached to a animal 
2 3 these are nice pacifiers but our daughter wouldn t take them :(
5 5 these are a must for parents our baby takes well to them and this color is easy to spot on the floor when they re dropped especially in low lighting 
5 5 love it
5 5 my granddaughter started using a wubbanub at birth and is still using it at 5 months all the designs are really cute i haven t seen one i don t like 
5 1 our 4 month old baby prefers the advent pacifier we believe this one is too heavy so he always spits it out 
5 5 love these i am hoping my 3 will love this soft lil dog i used one for my 2 but he didn t use it much just the right size for baby 
5 5 these are great and go well with the munchkin latch bottle system it helps avoid nipple confusion however my son seems to prefer the chicco natural fit pacifiers but will use both kinds 
5 5 great gift for a baby shower
5 5 my son loves these 
5 5 love these 
5 5 my daughter loves these perfect addition to our little menagerie arrived on time 
5 5 love these 
5 4 i ordered these thinking that my little one would like these just as well as the chicco natural fit hard shield pacifiers but he doesn t seem to like them quite as much they re heavier made from a different material and the ring on the back sticks out a lot he likes to move his hands around so he often knocks them out of his mouth 
5 5 so cute easy for baby to grab find on his own
5 5 this is a great starting set for any new born my wife loves mam and having four bottles and soothers in a single package is a great deal 
1 2 my baby didn t like it at all we went from the typical hospital pacifier and i tried this and it was a waste of money 1 year old big sister doesn t like it either 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my son likes i like that it is similar to a bottle so it doesn t confuse him 
5 5 i love it 
5 5 so cute every mom should have one of these cute creatures
5 5 everything was exactly what i d expected and within time frames 
5 5 great item fast shipping thanks
5 5 very cute design 
5 5 my babies favorite wubbanub 
5 5 my daughter loves this brand only and my wife loves the colors so win win
5 5 this is the fourth one i have bought each one has been great the best part it is completely washable just throw it in your washing machine and it s as good as new my son loves his dinosaur he likes to rub the legs as he falls asleep it is quite soothing i just bought this one and the frog for the new baby that arrives soon 
5 5 awesome for night time easy to find in the dark 
3 5 this little lamb is just so precious i was really hoping my daughter would love her wubbanub as much as i have seen so many other baby have but sadly nope but that isn t the companies fault these are just fantastic if i had to criticize one thing it would be that they are rather hard to sanitize i had been wiping it down with pacifier wipes but i like to boil and microwave sanitize my pacifiers and you are not able to do that with this i tried holding just the pacifier in boiling water but the steam got too hot and i was not able to hold it there long enough to count then dummy me thought it would be a good idea to prop it up on the side of the pot so that the just the pacifier was in the water and ended up getting char marks on the lamb don t do that otherwise it is great :(
5 5 love these they are exactly the same as the ones in the hospital i have bought 4 packs already and only because i m clumsy and keep losing them lol 
5 5 the cutest binkies ever my son loved them as a newborn but has decided he prefers mam as an older baby 
5 3 size is too big to 3 month baby 
5 5 great price love it 
5 4 good price 
5 5 my new born girl just love it much 
5 5 my baby loves the bottles and they are easy to clean and fill the numbers on the side are readable even when full of milk 
5 3 these are great but i m a bit worried about the moisture that can build up on the inside of the pacifier but baby loves them 
5 5 purchased these for our daughter that is to be born in a few weeks our son loved all time tippee products and we are hoping the same for our daughter 
5 5 too big for my three month old 
5 5 we have the dino version of this and my son loves it so we thought we d get one more of a different style these are good because it s a pacifier and a plush all in one during the night if he wakes up its easy for him to find in the dark and grab onto to put back in his mouth and go right back to sleep worth it s weight in gold to a sleep deprived parent note it s machine washable air dry 
5 5 just what u expect good product
5 5 i give these to all my friends who have babies i don t know if they appreciate the gift but it makes me laugh and besides everyone else is going to give them precious blue or pink or gender neutral binkies but what could be more gender neutral than a red and black vampire binky 
5 5 my son loves it and it matches his nyy outfits great deal a must buy to all the daddies out there 
5 5 this is a great price on these soothies my son has loved them since he was quite little he s nearly done with them as he gets closer to age 2 but at nighttime they re still a hit they work well with any pacifier clip too which is great for daycare easy to clean and durable he prefers these to any others including fancier and more expensive ones 
5 5 got lots of laughs at my cousin s baby shower from this
4 4 works perfectly product is just as described easy to use especially if you have a baby that likes the pacifier it can be difficult to use if you cannot get the baby to suck long enough or if their mouth is still too small to use it if i had to make the choice of an infant thermometer again i would pay a little more for a forehead thermometer which i imagine would be the easiest way to take a temperature 
5 5 the best pacifier in the world according to my grandson bonus as toy easier to find 
5 5 my baby loves these pacifiers and i already bought two more they are great and easy to find around the house 
5 5 this is a very nice diaper bag it doesn t have much padding but is lightweight there are lots of pockets to help you organize your baby s stuff two of the inside pockets are large enough to hold diapers and or wipes this bag features a swivel hook for keys the bag can be used as a shoulder bag it also has straps that are designed to attach to a stroller i love that feature i haven t had to test this but the bag is advertised to be waterproof made with waterproof 600d microfiber of course it is water resistant too easy to clean i really like this bag it s neatly stitched is lightweight waterproof has several inside outside pockets comes with several accessories changing pad bottle pacifier cases pvc bag for messy clothes a hanging swivel hook for your keys stroller straps the shoulder strap is not padded but the carrying handles are the main zippers all the straps handles are dark brown my daughter who will be using the bag loves the black bird design i think it would make a nice crochet tote too review sample provided 5 stars
5 5 we now own 3 wubbanub s because they are my daughters favorite she doesn t even need to be sucking on the pacifier part all the time she is content to simply be snuggling the little animal part she is teething now and she frequently takes out the pacifier and sticks one of the animal legs in her mouth instead the dogs are a little confused because they think all small stuffed animals are their toys but i just throw them in the washing machine whenever the dogs get to them and they wash right up i have washed mine a few dozen times now and they are all still holding up perfectly i will probably include one of these for every friend s baby shower in the near future 
5 5 love the fact i can have a different color than just the green 
5 4 doesnt always work the closing part when it hits the floor 
5 5 glow in the dark pacifiers are the best invention since sliced bread these are a must have for your little one 
5 5 these things are awesome my lo loves his wubbanubs 
5 5 nice quality 
5 5 great
3 4 very cute but not that soft 
5 5 my baby boy loves it so much i might have to buy an extra one in case we loose it
3 4 the pacifier itself is great however they do not glow in the dark at all i have the blue ones not sure about the others 
1 1 flimsy hook kept coming off everything and bending threw it away 
1 2 too big for my baby she didnt like at all it coz her gaging waste of money :(
5 5 love these pacifiers they are the only pacifiers my son will take 
5 5 best pacifiers and very cute colors 
5 5 my kid is obsessed with those wubbanub pacifiers which is fine except they cost like 13 because i would like to send my child to college i am unable to buy the requisite 13 or so she would like to have these soothies are the same pacifiers used on wubbanubs and are good in a pinch 
5 5 great pacifier for my 3 year old he is autistic and will not sleep without a pacifier these are the only ones he hasn t been able to chew through i do replace them every 2 months and i check them daily for any signs of rips or holes they are soft but strong and i like that they are made of natural rubber 
5 5 this is a must have for my son we have also purchased the lamb monkey and giraffe but this one is my favorite it seems more solid in size and unlike the giraffe there are no parts that make it difficult for a baby to use i e the neck of the giraffe makes it hard for a child to keep in their mouth the color of the bull also hides stains that don t come out in the wash and overall cute 
5 5 love it little pouch that i use to store pacifiers and wipes in the diaper bag not really big enough to be a true 34 wet bag 34 in the cloth diapering sense of the word however you could use it for cloth wipes keeps all paci s safe and easy to access :)
5 5 my daughter loves her wubba it has helped her with her hand and eye coordination she learned how to hold it which then helped her learn how to hold regular binkies my only compliant is it seems like it has a 3 6 month soothie on it and not a 0 3 it s a little large and hard for my infant daughter she gagged at first 
5 5 so cute and i m not too sure why but even when placed in the freezer teething only for a few minutes they still glow after being in a drawer before hand 
1 5 i ordered the blue they did not have holes in the nipple and my son keeps them in his mouth 
5 4 my son 19 months hates these but i love it he was super addicted to his paci 34 ya ya 34 as he called it but they were too small for his age and size enter these pacis they are huge and he hates it so he s actually self weaning and just chucks these out of his crib and across the room pretty funny my husband and i wanted to give our son the choice to use it himself he still does use these very occasionally but he s now happier without with his older pacis he would scream if we even tried to take it these he gives up voluntarily and easily i don t know if that s by design but anyways at 19 months he wasn t talking much with a paci in his mouth and now he has the freedom to speak his mind awesome we got a pack of the soccer and a pack of the football when i ordered 34 white 34 the particular sport didn t matter to us but just thought i d put in that detail for anyone concerned 
5 5 i am so happy baby brezza made this sterilizer after we made the decision to sterilize i wanted to get something that did not use the microwave yes the microwave sterilizers are 1 3 of the cost of this but i didnt feel safe using the microwave everyday on the bottles this system has a drying rack that is portable we use the bottom right option under the power button that is the sterilize dry feature it takes 60 minutes to run full cycle we load up 5 phillips advent bottles and 5 nipples in one run just make sure to add a little bit of water after ech use lift the removable drying tray and pour water into the circular base if you pour too much water it can prevent the machine from working properly it is the same as if not enough water 
5 5 my son loves this thing he loves to play with the animal and puts it back in his own mouth he used to like this a lot more but he prefers his avnet pacifier to this now he still likes it now and then have two and will buy one for all my future kids 
5 5 cutest 
5 5 adorable
5 5 we love the wubbanub we had a few for my daughter and have had a few now for my son they make it so you don t have to chase a constantly falling pacifier and the weight from the animal helps to keep it nearby as baby starts to learn to use their hands highly recommend these 
5 4 is really cool
5 5 this toy has saved our car rides with my 6 month old she would cry and cry lose her nuk and her toys in her car seat this offers a great distraction from being away from mom in the back seat we use the nuk pacifiers with the handles and they stay in securely i also used the teether toys which are cute but heavy i tried to do one teether toy and one nuk but the teether toy made one side too heavy and didn t work well either way she likes the teethers on their own the materials used are soft and the toy itself seems of high quality the cow design is so cute my one concern might be that the pulley system have a bit more tension to avoid sliding while my daughter has the pacifier in her mouth it is hardly a problem but i could see how it might be an issue if you had a younger less strong baby to pull it down and keep it in her mouth my pediatrician even thought the toy was a great idea at her last checkup baby girl loves this thing i it has really helped cease the screaming in the car great little toy and very useful for us 
5 5 i don t know how my first son made it through without these my second son is now 8 months old and still loves his wubbanub it s easier for them when they re little to find and to keep in their mouth as the stuffed animal part will just sit on their chest so if they open their mouth for minute it doesn t just roll away and with him at daycare this also acts as his 34 lovey 34 from home and helps him to self sooth the only problem at daycare is that all of the other babies want one too :)
5 5 adorable 
5 4 super cute and soft i did think it would be a little larger or have some weight to it i will never understand why it says 34 stretch 34 my daughter plays with it and chews the outer ring of the pacifier i thought this would help her hold on to a pacifier since her mouth is an odd shape and she has issues with most she s just taken to fingers instead lol no fault of the product 
5 4 he doesn t like it
1 3 she still not a fan of the pacifier not specifically this one any of them 
5 4 adorable pacifiers even come with their own individual cases
5 3 i like these pacifiers and i m sure they are a good product unfortunately my baby is used to the soothie pacifiers and don t not take to these these pacifiers constantly pop out of his mouth as he s trying to suck on them he will try to hold it in his mouth but the pacifier will continue to pop out i will keep trying to offer these to him in hopes that he gets used to it as i ve already spent money on two packages 
5 5 a gift for a newborn baby 
5 5 seem to disappear like socks in the dryer but i always come back for more because baby charlotte loves these 
5 5 great thermometer my son has had this one for five years and recommended it to me i love ours so much it has become one of the gifts i give to new parents 
5 5 baby loves ut
5 5 these pacifiers are the only pacifiers my daughter likes but she like to have it upside down the sucking part is still the same but on the top where it touches her lip has a tiny inscription and she decided to just put it upside down and she loves them 
5 5 perfect just love it will need to buy more 
5 5 these are my baby s favorite
5 3 buy colors for child and sent me girl colors
5 5 my baby loves this 
5 5 we use nothing but soothies right now and our daughter loves them unfortunately we keep losing them lol
5 5 love these pacifiers my baby loves them too they re lightweight so they don t fall out easily and they have cute designs 
5 5 baby lives these i can find them at night 
4 4 we love these i only gave 4 stars because i ve never seen them glow in the dark 
3 1 my son could not latch onto this without my finger in it not sure if that s how it s supposed to work but makes it pretty useless he latches onto other pacifiers like a pro also the few times he was able to latch for a few seconds it looked so creepy like silence of the lambs or something because you just see through the hole into his mouth as he sucks in hard to explain but just not for us 
1 1 very disappointing do not glow in the dark waste of money 
5 4 i got this because i wanted a paci i can hold from the handle unfortunately this one leaves imprints on my baby s cheeks she s got bigger cheeks than most babies she still loves sucking on it so it s my emergency paci 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my newborn seems to take i ve tried atleast 4 other types i like the bright yellow color because i used them for soothing her during bedtime and am able to easily spot it in her crib once she s asleep 
5 5 love that they are dishwasher safe my little one loves them 
5 5 we knew with our second child time was going to be short and precious with our first daughter i remember all the hours spent sanitizing and drying bottles this time around we decided to invest in this device and are happy we did there isn t much to say beyond it does what it is supposed to it saves us an enormous amount of time and that makes it worth the money once or twice a day we collect used bottles rinse them and remove anything major using a bottle brush and then load them up into the baby brezza usually we do this before going to bed it works its magic and bottles come out sparkling and dry it is a decent amount of money for something you can do for free so the real question is what is your time worth for our family a lot and any little device like this that can give us our time back is well worth the cost 
5 5 love these pacifiers and my daughter does too :)
5 5 have purchased two of the wubbanub my son loves it 
5 3 these pacifiers are great but i ordered them this time to get the pink and purple pack as an added gift for a baby girl shower i got the blue and green in the mail a little disappointing 
5 1 i have not had a single good reading from this thermometer better off spending a little more on a better thermometer 
5 5 purchased as a baby shower gift for a friend the actual pacifier is clear leaving you to see that cute little face beneath and it is bpa free the mustache is removable as necessary body friendly silicone and the most adorable thing you ever saw my friend absolutely loved it she laughed with unfettered mirth over the idea of it 
5 5 so stinking cute the small mustache is 0 6mo and larger one is 6 12 mo 
4 3 obviously they work and are great problem is i only give them to him inside the house because i was sent girl colors and not the boy colors not worth sending them back but very disappointed all the same now he just turned 6 months so i need the next size anyway but these kind work great and are shaped to be more natural 
3 5 ok
5 5 i bought this for my grandson it s very nice it exceeds my expectations 
5 5 gift for my cousin saw the pacifier on shark tank thought it was very ingenious ordered it the same night my lil cousin is still to young to appreciate it but we will see as she gets older 
5 5 everyone thinks this is the cutest thing ever the baby loves it too 
5 5 these are my baby s favorite she has liked them since she was a newborn and now that she is almost 5 months old she likes to stick her finger in the middle and take it in and out of her mouth it is also a good teething device 
5 3 the material is harder than it used to be the ones i bought from bru a year ago are much softer 
5 5 love wubbanubs perfect for keeping passy from rolling all over or under the couch or bed stays put when falls out of baby s mouth and easy to find if dropped also serves as a lovey 
5 5 love wubbanubs perfect shower gift
5 5 know a new parent that is a sox fan i do and what better thing to get him it s different from the typical baby gifts quality made and safe for babies help your friend indoctrinate the little sports fan early 
5 5 this monitor has great range with perfect visual and audio clarity throughout our house we love how we can see our 5mo day or night and when we mute the sound the color wheel lets us know when he is making noise and moving around also very useful is the camera which can be adjusted remotely if our son moves around the crib we are able to adjust the camera from the screen without disturbing him in his room 
5 4 great pattern but getting it on the pillow was the hardest part good tight fit 
5 5 it s cute and perfect for glamping our camper shabby chic it is small and still a little sparkly enough for what i need had to go with a plugin no switch for hard wire the only problem it only came with one bulb not 3 as stated 
4 5 these work just as expected they cover outlets tightly but not so tight so you would need a screwdriver to pry them off good for keeping little fingers out of sockets 
5 5 excellent milk bags never leaked once highly recommended
5 4 fantastic product yes you have to drill to install so be ready for that but it works great and looks like it was made to fit my sliding glass door works on both left to right and right to left sliders i installed this in about 20 minutes four stars instead of 5 because the directions are super confusing it had a template you cut out and tape to the door i just held the actual lock up to the door and used a pencil to mark the holes much easier 
5 5 quick arrival the packaging could have been better but the product works great and as expected good purchase for sure 
5 5 havent used it yet but its really nice for the price my note 3 phone fits in the phone slot and our galaxy tab fits in the tablet slot as well it has a cute little pacifier pocket as well my only beef is there arent pockets on the inside but i may go buy an insert to solve that the quality is really nice feels durable the changing pad is small dont expect a big one the wipes compartment snaps pretty well i guess that will have to wait for use 
5 5 so cute and inexpensive
5 5 great easy to clean and kids like the novelty of it 
5 5 it is not very easy to fill with a spoon i am also a little confused where the max fill line is my one year old likes it 3 year old prefers the 34 real thing 34 the store bought pouches i was very skeptical and feared that there will be leaks or explosions but so far 2 weeks so good i upgraded by rating from 4 to 5 stars after my review the company contacted me and give some suggestions about the fill line such a wonderful customer service thank you 
5 5 this suit was a lifesaver for my son we started using it when he was maybe 4 5 months old to transition him from swaddled in the rock and play to unswaddled in his crib the first night in it he slept all night hadn t been prior to that he was always so calm in his suit and never woke up transitioning from my arms to the crib he slept late in the mornings until 7 30 or so and generally slept all night in it the weight of it fabric was perfect we had the cotton in va never too hot but kept him warm fast forward to now he s almost 8 months and i am trying to wean him off of it it s going terribly to say the least he became very dependent on the suit for all night sleeping after a week of no sleep for me i put him in it last night to try and let us all get some sleep and after being out of it he was rolling over in it which he had never before attempted i guess that s the end of our wonderful days in this suit
5 5 have used for several years easily washed and travels with ease 
5 5 great product just what i was looking for 
1 1 i came on amazon to find a new stars projector for my son because his just caught on fire tonight when scrolling and seeing this i felt i needed to warn other parents this is the exact one we have the battery life was decent but when the batteries died we decided to just buy the adaptor since he uses it every night first the white led blew after a few months of use whatever still had the colored light show then tonight i started to smell a weird hot electronics smell as we were reading our story i notice the smell getting stronger and when i turned his overhead light on i noticed the smoke pouring out of it with black streaks up the side of it unplugged it and threw the stupid thing in the sink 
5 5 this is amazing it s really light weight and easy to hold for my four month old i had to show her how to rub the little rubber bristles on her gums and it was all over from there we have to fight her to get it back when it s time to eat or go to bed she uses it as a teether and won t take anything else 
5 5 this is great perfect for everyday 
5 5 excellent carrier if you re wondering if the extra money is worth it for the organic vs original fabric yes it is it s much softer and less chaff y when wearing it in warm weather with a tank top or anything sleeveless shoulderless and you ll feel a lot better about your child gnawing on the strap which is inevitable this is my third child and i have carried all of them in a variety of different contraptions original bjorn sports bjorn becco much prefer this one we live in nyc and do a lot of walking and this has been the most comfortable on my back and shoulders it s easy to put on while holding the child which is impossible with the bjorn and fairly easy to move into back holding position without assistance the pocket is also great for holding your phone and wallet it poufs out a bit so the items dangle away from your child rather than rubbing against them i ordered the zen and received the dandelion pattern instead looks like the sticker barcode on the box was mislabeled but amazon customer service handled the issue quickly and professionally am i the only one a little unnerved by the casual tone of some other companies zappos made an error on an order and sent me an email that literally said 34 sorry man 34 not so with amazon and i appreciate that 
5 5 great idea my daughter was having problem with potty training till we got this watch now she goes every time it goes off 
5 5 this may be named a toddler pillow however i would like to deem it as my universal pillow i actually use this pillow as my go to pillow when rest my weary head it really depends on my circumstance for the evening when i lay down to sleep if my shoulders or neck hurts i will use this pillow as a wedge between my head and neck in an attempt to give myself comfort when a level head is needed or if my back has been bothering me i will use it as a wedge between my legs knees in my opinion this pillow works well for it s intended purposes i actually did let my 4 yr old use it the night i first received it he used it while watching t v downstairs with the family it was after i took him up to bed did i need something to ease my discomfort and the pillow was the closest possibility to me i have not used this for travel we don t travel in the ways that would require pillows but have found the perfect use for my needs it also comes with a removable case that is washable which is a lifesaver as these style and size pillow cases aren t readily available i was able to test this product out as a promotional purchase for review purposes i actually use this pillow
5 5 my daughter loves this i like how you can adjust the height 
5 5 the product came to me well and on time without any problem i m already using and it works perfectly totally recommend 
5 5 this is awesome every patent should have one for there child 
5 5 cute adheres well 
5 4 i will never be able to use the nosefrida it would result in me throwing up on the baby this works pretty well my little one thinks it s hilarious until i try to put it in his nose when he has boogers then he tries to push it away clean nose no problem stuffy and congested get it away that said it s been pretty effective and is fairly easy to clean 
5 5 i ordered this when i was still pregnant and it was super easy to put together it looks and is amazing soft and cushiony for my little angel 
5 5 love these bibs very high quality and gorgeous colors i hate that most other bibs out there have velcro these are perfect 
5 5 love it absolutely perfect for a diaper bag and short trips out fits 3 scoops of formula in each section easily 
5 5 i absolutely adore violet the interaction between child and toy is a huge reason why i am a fan of the leapfrog company violet can be programmed with the child s name as well as several other favorites the songs and games that she does are very sweet i can t wait to see how helpful the lullabies are thankfully there are quite a few available to pick from i may invest in the scout version of this toy as well 
5 5 i was a bit hesitant to allow my son to play with these i was worried that they wouldn t be easy to clean off the tub walls and would stain i was wrong i just used a wet washcloth after he was done and it came right off will definitely purchase more in the future 
4 4 wish it was bigger great product
5 4 bought this as a gift they loved it 
5 5 my wife says i love this my baby sleeps directly on it it is soft unlike the old ones that were stiff and uncomfortable i will be buying another one 
5 5 too cute for words bought for my neice and everyone loved it 
5 5 excellent
1 1 i would not recommend this product it came one day later which is not a problem it is cheap looking very low quality and very small not worth the money 
5 5 same as what he was given in the hospital thicker rubber then most pacifiers so by the time he start teething he s not going to bite through them 
5 5 my granddaughter loves it 
3 5 my son is not a fan of pacifiers but if he s in the mood he ll use this or his wubba nub nub that uses a soothies pacifier i did not like this at first because the tip doesn t have a radial symmetry that i was looking for only a linear symmetry i was not able to tell true shape of the tip based on the pictures i was hoping that it would be more like soothies but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better regardless it doesn t seem to bother him my favorite part about this pacifier though is that when he drops it it almost always with the mouth part up or butter side up as it were the oval part is heavier perhaps on purpose so it almost always turns the pacifier in flight and lands in the ideal position of course a tether would be even better so that it couldn t be dropped on the floor at all but as i mentioned my son isn t a fan of pacifiers so we don t have one leashed to him 24 7 
5 5 glow in the dark make them easy to find in the middle of night mam is a great brand the silicone nipple is just the right size for my small newborn other brands like nuk and playtex just simply don t work and don t feel natural 
5 5 purchased for an added gift for the male boss as his wife is having baby perfect gift that is cute useful and funny 
5 5 love wubbanubs perfect christmas gift
5 5 love wubbanubs perfect easter gift
5 3 she didn t like these at all but they look cute 
5 5 these are my baby s favorite she has liked them since she was a newborn and now that she is almost 5 months old she likes to stick her finger in the middle and take it in and out of her mouth it is also a good teething device 
5 5 my granddaughter loves it 
5 1 i washed these pacifiers with soap and i rinsed it very well but i guess there was some soap stuck inside because when i gave it to my 2 week old daughter there was soap bubbles coming out of her mouth when i took the paci from her it was full of soap 
5 5 great thanks
5 5 fast shipping quality product the newest member of the family is a ladieeees mannnnn 
5 5 i waited until our son was about a month old before introducing a pacifier we tried a bunch of different brands before a lactation consultant recommended these and voila he took it next time i won t hesitate to introduce these as soon as i feel that breastfeeding is off to a good start that he has a good latch is gaining weight etc 
4 4 works well but like others have said the pacifier part is quite long and will gag your baby especially if they aren t the type to take a pacifier normally i like that the display lights up and turns red if the temp is too high 
5 4 this was offered to us in the hospital when baby was 2 days old so we ordered some more from amazon baby didnt like using the purple one we later realised that it had a hole in it and baby would suck in air so we threw one out otherwise its a good product 
5 5 adorable
4 4 trying to find a smooth transition from the newborn soothies these are smaller than imagined but i suppose any are in comparison baby seems to like them but soothies are irreplaceable
5 5 baby loves these pacis
5 5 great thanks
5 5 great for breastfed babies helps them not to develop bad latching techniques compared to orthodontic and flat pacifiers 
5 5 the best pacifiers hands down the base is so thin that they are less likely to cause an overbite 
5 5 beautiful and perfect my children use the mam pacifier since they were born now they have 2 and a half years old and still use the pacifier wich are very safe and durable 
5 5 perfect for baby boo
5 5 my son uses mam pacifiers and i highly recommend getting these glow in the dark pacifiers i originally purchased one pack and then bought two more easy to find in the middle of the night without turning on the light i place them under his bedroom lamp during the day and they glow bright longer at night and during nap great pacifiers 
5 5 my son really did not like to take the pacifier until we purchased this wubbanub anytime you d put the soothie in his mouth he would spit it out i think the weight of the giraffe on the end makes it easier for him to keep it in his mouth he now falls asleep easily with the wubbanub in his mouth and i am pretty sure we will be ordering another one just in case 
5 5 cute 
5 5 my mom used mam bottles with us 24 years ago so my first choice when picking a bottle and pacifier system was mam our newborn took these at two days old absolute lifesaver when she s overtired and wants to comfort suckle when i can t just drop what i m doing usually changing her and let her comfort nurse we had 0 nipple confusion problems with these she s gone back and forth from breast to bottle from day one the self sterilising feature is life saver number two much easier to just pop them in the microwave than to boil anything 
5 5 i always keep a pack of these in my diaper bag they re great for when my son drops his pacifier or teether and also for when my daughter s sippy needs a quick wipe down while we re out and about i ve actually even wiped down my breast pump with these and put the pump parts in the fridge until the next use when i didn t have access to a bottle brush 
5 5 only kind of binkies my baby will use 10 months old and won t touch any other ones
5 5 great 
5 4 other then shipping problem it s great my baby loves it
5 5 nuk is the best brand 
5 5 my grandson loves it 
4 4 harder than expected
5 5 i like this
5 4 great for little babies with small mouths my daughter choked on all other pacifiers has worked great she s 3 months old and we will continue to use 
5 4 beutiful
5 4 excellent
5 5 our daughter loves these 
1 3 did not ordered them 
5 4 great item 
3 2 they re ok i guess i prefer the munchkin latch lightweight pacifier much more
5 5 quality is good very cute my 4 month old daughter loves it 
5 5 if you have an issue with your baby trying to put it in their mouth and are afraid they will choke this cannot fit in any way that they might be able to 
5 5 very cute
5 5 i have tried just about every pacifier on the market not to fond of the nuk and nuby because of the two piece assembly i love the one piece pacifiers these are great because they re one piece and very soft i won t use any other one now 
5 5 this is the only paci my breastfed baby would take it is pricey and not the most attractive pacifier on the market but they are good quality baby loves them 
1 1 my baby did not like the pacifier shape and the sides would irritate her cheeks i would not recommend this to anyone 
5 5 was a gift for a new mother she said she loves it 
4 5 not the colors they show to be but work like any color does
5 5 only paci my 3 babies will use one full term baby and twin preemies make sure you get real ones not the first years imitation ones 
5 5 my daughter loved this pacifier toy combo easy to hold soft and plush oh so cute and i liked that the pacifier was similarly shaped as a nipple in my mind not scientifically proven it helped avoid nipple confusion and did not hinder my daughter s breast feeding ability 
5 5 this was a gift but i have seen first hand that babies love these things cant go wrong with anything longhorn themed :)
5 5 we love wubba s at our house my son always had a hard time keeping his pacifier in his mouth which meant i was constantly putting it back in for him the plushy on the wubba s help the pacifier not only stay in but make it easy for him to grab and stick back in his mouth especially helpful at night time love them 
5 3 these are great binkies and i know they say animals colors will vary but i received 2 very gender specific pacifiers for girls when i have a boy i thought they would at least have 1 of each or more gender neutral 
5 5 this was the brand given in the hospital i went home with two it was a bit of a frustration for the first 6 weeks because my baby could not keep this in his mouth for too long without assistance however i wanted to stick with it because it s the only pacifier shaped most similarly to a real nipple and i didn t want to introduce the chance of nipple confusion with a different pacifier right at 6 weeks he was able to handle it much more consistently at 8 weeks he could keep it in his mouth all by himself now at 11 weeks he s quite a pro i no longer have to reach over and help him keep it in his mouth one day i gave him a different pacifier brand received this different one as a gift and i noticed that he had some difficulty latching to the breast for that whole day back to the soothie and no problems since then i ordered two packs of the 3 month size from amazon i saw them in rite aid but they were a bit more expensive it would be perfect if it came with a case i ordered a separate plastic case any basic pacifier clip with velcro attachment can work to clamp it to baby s shirt the pacifier has two holes so you can put the strap through the hole and keep it at hand 
5 5 they may be hard to find when you loose them by my son loves these pacifiers the best and i like that they are clear so they match any outfit
5 5 my daughter is 7 months and still uses these over the older ones 3 6 months this is the only pacifier she will take
5 5 cute baby not here yet so untested 
5 5 well made one
5 3 if my daughter liked using pacifiers i m sure she would like these she just hasn t taken to the pacifier 
5 4 our child loves these the vanilla scent really has a calming effect on her 
3 3 i guess it was my fault but they are huge 
5 5 great and quick transaction no problems at all 
5 5 great
5 5 babe likes these a lot her first time using a binky she took to these right away my breasts are so grateful i like that its bpa free and has the extra holes for air flow 
5 5 great
5 5 our lactation consultant recommended these over the soothies as they maintain better habits i m not 100 sure what she means by that but the kid loves these and took to them almost immediately they are all one piece which makes for easy cleaning and you can see through them and be amused by the sucker fish face the kid makes when using them selling these in multi packs is a great idea 
5 5 good
1 1 this item has a proposition 65 warning you can click on it in the product description and read yourself don t buy 
5 5 what i expected 
5 5 our first gumdrop was given to us by our doula we had tried others but for some reason our son only took to this brand ended up buying four more during the two years he used a soother 
5 5 this is so cute i got it to go along with a baby shower gift this should come in very handy 
5 5 these pacifiers are wonderful when you need one in the middle of the night i was pleasantly surprised by their quick charging ability and also their ability to hold a charge for a long period of time my son loves his mam pacifiers and these make locating them in a dark nursery or crib much easier when trying to get a fussy baby back to sleep 
5 5 cute 
5 5 good
5 5 the little boy loves it having teethed he eats pacifiers as he would candy if permitted wubbanub is offered at a good price and are quality product he insists on the gobblegoods having a soft cuddly toy and this one and the others i ordered like it is perfect for him 
5 5 these are soooo cute and great deal everywhere else we ve seen them they re at least 4 5 dollars we got these as add ons for a little more than 2 
3 4 pacifiers are fine they serve the purpose 
5 5 my baby prefers latex over silicone and it s hard to find cute designs these are great 
5 5 baby loves this soother
5 4 we love these pacifiers 
5 5 super cute and soft i only wish my baby took a pacifier
5 5 the best pacifier 
1 1 product had broken on off button motorola is aware of this problem and will not take the monitor back instead they want you to pay 90 for an upgraded version would not buy again 
5 5 this mirror is great my husband and i bought two other mirrors but because the headrest in my suv does not move we could not find one that worked until i found this one i just had to snake the strap between the top of the seat and the headrest the other mirrors we bought didnt fit around the headrest and required the headrest to rise in order for it to be secured the daffadooy mirror itself is huge and clear and angles perfectly making it much safer to look at my little guy i think the only thing i wish it had was a light for at night like the brica mirror has 
5 5 i love it makes pumping expressing so much easier 
5 5 easy and light to carry around anywhere fits in my wallet love that i can throw them out and my baby is still so clean
5 4 the little hood thing is very flimsy but the actual stroller is sturdy and has held up well 
4 5 i love this print the diaper seems to be well made my newborn is still too small to wear it yet though 
4 4 this bassinet is adorable i love the colors and style i bought it because it was cheaper than some others and looked great the only reason i have 4 stars instead if 5 is because i don t feel like the glider feature is very good it glides but not very smoothly nothing i can t deal with though i hardly glide rock it anyway love the little baskets it comes with and the little mattress is just what a newborn needs it s supposed to be firm looking back i would have just saved a little more and bought the delta that doesn t glide but i m happy and do recommend it 
5 5 wow this necklace is beautiful it seems to be much better quality than the one i got from an expensive local boutique type store i ordered the raw honey colored necklace the packaging is so cute and i love the informative insert too i love the size of it and right after i put this on baby she smiled drank a bottle and took an hour and forty five minute nap this would make an excellent baby shower gift too thank you so much 
5 5 perfect fit to sit in the back seat right behind the console the velcro has also kept it in place perfectly 
3 1 was expecting alot with all the great reviews but ended up having to return it for 2 reasons 1 it must be doused in chemicals as it smells like paint when you open the box not sure if it gets better with washing or airing it out it was so strong i didn t want to try 2 it s heavy being this is meant for transport picnic park etc and you ll be carrying it around it s crazy heavy guessing that means it s really sturdy and good quality but too heavy for me to deal with 
5 5 my 3 year old daughter loves it she turns it on every night i would definitely recommend this product 
5 5 this is a great product i ve used it with my son several times like most people say after about 90 minutes there is some discomfort however i have noticed i find myself holding him while in the carrier this will alleviate a lot of the pressure on your back or i will have him do his practice standing on surfaces while we re out togetheroverall for the value this is a great product i would most definitely buy it again great product and a good price
5 5 very adorable item shipped extremely quick and the packaging gift box for this item is adorable highly recommend
5 5 i always eyed this rattle in the baby toy aisle but was skeptical it was worth 4 found it for 50 and decided to get it and i wish i had never hesitated my 3 5 month old grips the cross style body easily and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys the mirror side makes the balls seem to glow and always catches eye this and his take along tunes have been his diaper bag must haves 
5 5 my granddaughter loved it for her new arrival he ll be sitting in it after a couple of months and mom will have no worries about germs going into his mouth or on his hands 
5 5 the jar is with bright color and it s wonderful for my daughter 
5 5 received quickly and as described this mirror is very easy and quick to put together and attach to the seat the large mirror lets you see what the baby is doing clearly and you can adjust it to whatever angle is good for you i like that it is shatterproof for safety reasons this is a must for the car using the rear facing baby seats i received this at a discount for my unbiased honest opinion these are my own words after trying the product 
5 5 this was a popular item at my great niece s baby shower soft and pink and cuddly what more is required 
1 4 they definitely do not soak through but start to look dingy after washing
5 5 so cute and so soft easy for my 4 mo old to grap
5 5 cute and cuddly arrived on time and packaged well 
5 5 my baby loves it
5 5 great
5 3 i like
5 5  the package didn t include 8 corners what is advertised excellent quality and cost effectives though the seller sent the missing pieces promptly
5 5 love it perfect for camping
5 5 love this lightweight foldable great to use on planes or in public places 
5 5 i have been using this for almost 3 years now and it has worked very well of course by now it has some signs of wear but i was very pleased to buy this product 
5 5 love these
4 3 pain in the butt to work
5 3 bulky you can see them through your clothing
5 5 fast and as described
5 5 expected three and only got one 
5 1 we love sassy spoutless cups in this house our one year old twins won t use anything else we have been searching for an insulated cup for them and when i saw these i knew i had to try them sadly they leak all over the place i know i am putting the lids on correctly as we have other cups like this i m very disappointed and now on the search again 
5 5 after lots of research and wasting so much money on cups looking for a sippy that doesn t spill milk everywhere this one i have to agree is the best in that category i have not able to get my 15 month girls to drink milk from anything but bottles this has worked pretty good one likes it the other not so much i will say it just seems very close to a bottle but i just ordered the straw attachment so i am hoping to switch to that soon i love the color coding for use with twins one gets purple the other pink that would have saved a lot of time keeping soy vs milk separate for my girls there is one problem if you are putting cold milk or water in them they are unbearably cold to hold the up side of that is the drink is going to stay colder longer i have ordered the silicone sleeve i think that will fix the problem rather easily over all i am very happy with this bottle i just wish i had tried them sooner instead of the bottles i used they are very easy to clean no extra parts to clean they have many top options nipple supper straw or just a cap so these could be the only covered containers you ever have to buy from baby to older kids i suggest looking at their website it states that other brand nipples can be used and lists the ones that work also thay are coming out with new colors of silicone sleeves august 2015 
5 5 a must for summer large and sturdy easily collapsible 
3 3 ok i like these a lot but i would liked them even more if i got the i healthy something s instead we got i cookies ice cream french fries would have liked the bananas peas or avocado instead 
5 5 got mine a while back before it was available on amazon and love it it s true that the holes are small but i usually take my son s shoes off before i put him in and it s a piece of cake my son also likes to stand up which he can do but since he s buckled in i don t worry about him falling out he can reach groceries but he d be able to reach them if he weren t in the seat too really the only draw back is that literally every time i ve used it i ve had people ask me where i got it but that s really not a negative 
5 5 i work in an nicu and this is our favorite swing it is given to our fussiest babies the different options including some pretty fast motions and mimic a person i feel it is does work like a person as these swings and being held by a person are what works best for the fussiest babies compared to more traditional swings as an rn like a mom i can t carry the babies 24 7 so this swing works wonders plus you can operate it with your feet if you have your hands full so that is helpful haha 
4 4 this is easy to put together looks nice and holds baby comfortably it works as described and for that i give four stars however there are much better more versatile options in the same price range this seat isn t very exciting it vibrates and has two little toys to bat at no music and the toys are quite basic for just a few dollars more try the deluxe rainforest bouncer the toy bar is much more interesting with moving animals and a light up waterfall and it plays a variety of songs it takes the same floor space and you can choose what action and sounds you want to play to avoid overstimulation and preserve your sanity my older son enjoyed this seat and it was my primary ticket to a decent shower for months for a few dollars less there s the fisher price infant to toddler rocker this converts from a baby bouncer vibrates and has simple toys like this bouncer to a seat for toddler thus getting you a little more use out of your purchase this bouncer is good for very young babies and it has a more contemporary look and does what it says but i would recommend either of those options over this 
5 5 five stars aren t enough for this pillow i have arthritic problems with my neck and shoulders painful enough to wake me up at night after a failed search for a pillow that would be firm enough to provide support yet soft enough to be comfortable i bought this one and from the first night it was perfect slept through the night and woke up pain free a big 34 thank you 34 to the dreamtown kids 
5 5 does the job well and the easy storage is actually quite useful its a great product 
5 5 love it my lo don t like anything under the the head but she likes this one still waiting for head to stay in shape 
5 5 i love my baby furniture from spot on the square i got the eicho crib conversion kit and matching dresser changing table they are both modern and made of non toxic materials i had a problem with the delivery service that brought me my furniture spot on the square and the store i bought the furniture from acted quickly to solve the problem i appreciate the companies commit to both quality and customer service 
5 4 very soft wrap and beautiful print a little complicated to put on 
5 5 my son s loves it 
5 5 my granddaughters favorite she will not take anything else other than these binkys nothing else soothes her 
5 5 it great we are still working on the pacifiers 
5 4 they were here earlier than expected and they are awesome 
5 5 can t say enough good things about this little kitty my daughter loves it when she was itty bitty the kitty would balance on her belly and help keep the pacifier in her mouth as she got bigger the kitty would allow her to pick up the pacifier easily and put it back in her mouth plus we don t have trouble finding it when she drops it because the kitty is easy to spot it s also easy to wash i either toss is in the washer and then air dry it or i just smother it with dish soap rinse and air dry i buy these little things as gifts for all the baby showers i go to you should probably get one =)
5 5 my son loves these they are so cute when needed to be washed i just hand wash the stuffed animal with light mild soap and put in the dryer on low heat for a few minutes at a time or air dry 
5 5 love it
5 5 they glow all night 
5 5 super cute my son loves watching the monkey great idea 
5 3 they are ok the case they came in completely cracked 
4 4 the elephant was smaller than i expected but it was still super cute and worth the money
2 1 baby wouldn t take it because of the smell and shape
5 5 my baby loves his wubbanub he likes soothies but doesn t have a very strong suck so they fall out of his mouth a lot before he was grasping things just the friction from having the stuffed animal on this chest would keep the pacifier from falling out of his reach now he can grasp at the stuffed animal and hold it in himself or kind of maneuver it back in if it falls out it makes a great lovey and soother 
5 3 didn t come with separate cover 
5 5 quality item 
5 5 great pacifier our baby loves the 34 soothies 34 and having these little animals on the end helps keep the paci in his mouth
5 2 these were very disappointing each cloth is so wet that i have to literally wring out the moisture before i actually use them it then leaves behind a lot of moisture i bought these to use to clean my pump parts when taking my pump to the office the munchkin arm hammer wipes work much better 
5 5 my son likes these 
5 5 my son likes these
5 5 super cute and easier to fill out and keep track of milestones than a traditional baby book highly recommend 
5 5 i received my rainier in the color glacier today i was so excited to finally have it but i was also somewhat stressed about putting it together after reading countless reviews on how hard it is to install surprisingly it wasn t as difficult as i thought it would be our first car seat was a britax b safe 5 point harness so we kind of already had a heads up on this system and adjusting all the straps we skipped right to the short instructional videos on youtube that help explain step by step how to step up the car seat in the car let me tell you they were a life saver there s nothing like watching someone actually setting it up instead of reading instructions and looking at the pictures i m more of a hands on person the car seat looks very well constructed it definitely feels very safe and incredibly comfy the color was so nice which was an added bonus all in all i m very impressed and happy with this purchase 
5 5 works great for my 16 month old i think it would be even better for younger kids 
5 5 it was a gift and she loved it
5 5 great potty seat urine does get on the regular toilet seat after using it tho so you have to remember to wipe it off unless you want to sit in pee lol besides that it s awesome fits the toilet well fits every toilet well since it s adjustable i d definitely buy it again 
5 5 we have a 50 samsung tv that we just purchased and we feel much better with the anti tip straps connected to the top of the back and the back edge of the tv stand you want the straps to go straight down to the back edge of the stand not at an angle to the right or left when you are sitting in front of the tv you don t notice the straps as they are pure black the straps when tightened have no flexibility so they create a very secure environment incidentally i don t recommend connecting them to the wall for two reasons 1 if the tv stand gets bumped it can cause the straps to be pulled and 2 if you want to gently move the stand to clean or work on the wiring in the back the straps would need to be disconnected from their wall anchors leaving you without their intended support and this system is good to have when there are youngsters and oldsters around 
5 5 purchased based on others recommendation and this is one of the best purchases i have ever invested from baby food accessories perspective 1 oz portion is great size to have and you can pretty much store any food you like and it s easy to get the cube out just need to follow the instruction highly recommended 
1 1 it said 8 oz equipped with round hole medium nipple 3 6m but received 0 3m cross cut nipple 
5 5 i bought 12 month and now 18 month size for my son machine washed multiple times the fabric colors held up pretty good 
4 3 the image is good but if your house is big or your rooms has wall between the living room and the bedroom you won t see the baby because it says it has no signal this product is good for an open house display or small apartment but the range is too little 
5 5 my daughter has refused all types and sizes of pacifiers except this one it saved me when my husband was out of town for a week she doesn t take it frequently but occasionally is good enough i think its because she is breastfed and it is most similar to her 
5 5 good
5 3 i am really conflicted writing this review as this seemed to be the only sling my 6 week old will use i just cannot understand the bulky wraps that come with miles of material despite trying several times brands with my first baby and my newborn now my newborn hated the moby and boba wraps did not like being in the baby k tan tried 2 sizes just to be sure will tolerate the beco gemini for a bit and hates the ergo baby with newborn insert also seems to be way too warm for a newborn to sit in during the summer both the beco and ergo seem better for older babies toddlers can attest from experience with my first daughter the ergo is great when baby is bigger i bought the balboa sling one day before heading out shopping without checking reviews first and my baby loved it slept peacefully the whole time was able to feed her easily and always had her little face in view when i took the time to check for reviews i was shocked to see the worrisome info about potential chin to chest problems and suffocation in newborns researched further and most of the info i found was related to infant deaths in 2010 with a similar but still different sling it also seems the babies who suffered were premature or underweight so definitely do not use with children under 8lbs the chin to chest is also a problem that can occur in an infant carseat or swing but obviously i have not stopped using a carseat honestly though using the sling is not a risk i personally am willing to take no matter how small instead i am going to try a ring sling as others have suggested and cross my fingers it works 
4 5 if the baby doesn t like it then she can flip the bill 
5 5 i love the adjustable handlebar in the new flex bob revolution is the best there is in terms of strollers very satisfied the duallie fits through all doors in public but people are quick to comment or help hold doors when they see you heading for an exit they underestimate the skills of a momma or the precision of bob worth every cent good sale on amazon around labor day 
5 5 good 
3 3 the material is breathable n super soft which i personally love however the threads come off very easily since we are dealing with diaper rash tubes the edges of the tube frequently gets stuck on the sheet pulling off the threads just don t find this sheet very durable 
5 3 cute and great for small babies 
5 5 i bought two of these the lion and the orangutan one for each of my kids they re very cute and fit a lot of clothes and i love that you just unfold the tops and carry them to the laundry room 
5 5 awesome product i love this brand worth the money fast shipping too 
5 5 love this potty it s so easy to use and it s really cute the size is good too smaller then some i ve seen and smaller then our other one but i like that better it has a good pee guard for boys too although for my son it seemed like he would always shoot pee up and over the guard it s just a part of boy life i think that you have to teach them to hold their junk down while they are peeing lol that took care of that he s almost 4 so now he uses the regular toilet except he has this upstairs in case he has to pee at night easy to clean and still looks new actually
5 5 thank you for the stable product like this
3 4 i like them unfortunately the baby didn t care for the shape not nipple like 
5 5 great cover and really cute we ve been using it for 3 months the diaper has held up nicely and i love how it grew with my son it s so customizable 
5 5 this toy is super cool my daughter loved it
5 5 sticks very well colors are vibrant without being too bright 
5 5 great for grandkids
5 1 the sippy cups seem very nice my child has had no problems using them but she dropped one from her highchair and it shattered with the frequency of how often she drops the sippy cups i need something more durable 
4 4 great high chair easy to put together though my husband had to tighten all the screws because it was too hard for me to get them tight enough the toy is kind of useless though my son sits in it to eat not to play even if he is sitting in it while i prepare food in the kitchen i usually give him something to snack on while he sits the toy is kind of big and bulky needless to say the toy part is in the playroom and he isn t very interested in it as a high chair alone it s great though easy material to wipe down and clean no hidden cracks hiding food pieces love that is has wheels to role easily around from one spot to the next kind of pricey though if you re debating this one for the toy alone don t spend the extra money 
4 4 a wonderful seat however it doesn t fit as snug as i would like as our toilet seat is a tad bit longer than the seat so there is a little space between the two however it still functions well and my fighter feels very comfortable sitting on it i would haut measure your toilet seat if you are wanting all rim seems to fit :)
3 2 does not work as well as i hoped the lower pockets are not accessible in a chevy truck most of the pockets are too small to be useful it keeps slipping off the side of the seat the lower strap will not stay tight disappointed
5 5 this stroller is hands down the best single stroller jogger umbrella or other type that i have used i have used the uppababy peg perego and a few other brands used for 2 kids so far and it is in great condition here s why i think it is best 1 these wheels are awesome and so so durable they have yet to receive a flat or a puncture i hope never and we only fill up air maybe twice a year the ride is so smooth and i am able to push this stroller with one hand 2 the double tray genius why don t all other strollers have this option my kids both loved the tray they were able to put their cups bottles food toys etc while i was able to keep more than enough in the 34 parent 34 tray a water bottle my keys phone money etc 3 super easy to fold 4 the price 103 so affordable and you get more than your money s worth i would think this is at least a 250 stroller most strollers under 150 are usually so cheaply made and have horrible wheels that make you suffer to no end and pray that your child will start walking so that you do not need to use a stroller anymore the baby trend is clearly in a different league and i really appreciate that the manufacturer takes our budget into consideration there is no reason that a parent on a budget needs to suffer with a low quality stroller just because they can t afford or don t want to spend 400 on a stroller 5 the canopy so flexible and able to fully cover my child from the sun 
1 1 cute gate and quality materials used but i have tried it on the inside of the door frame on the door frame and even across different walls outside of doors with no luck on making a secure grip either my apartment is completely abnormal or the measurements for the gate are off bc my 2 lb kitten can knock it right over making my purchase completely useless 
5 5 my little one loves his pillow it is a perfect size and softness for him we even take it with us when we travel it fits perfectly in his suitcase wonderful product 
5 5 i am obsessed with these bibs they are very high quality and not to mention adorable i ve ordered 3 different sets and about to order more please keep making these the owner also emailed me making sure that i liked the product i thought that was a pleasant surprise :)
5 5 my son had not used a straw before this cup we started using it when he was 16 months he quickly figured it out we only use water in it since anything else would seem hard to clean out of the straw 
5 5 it s awesome 
5 5 very nice material for baby to scoot crawl and learn to walk it is hard enough to allow for crawling but soft enough to protect a baby if they falls 
5 5 easy to fold and open in less than a minute wipe down to clean and great for my now crawling little one so he can play at the park i compared this brand to others before purchasing and checked out friends who already own it and spoke highly of it definitely would recommend 
5 5 fei chang hao hahahahahaha
4 4 like that the bib has sleeves but do not like the tie on the neck when you tie it it still leaves a gap around the neck where food can get on your child s neck i think they need to work on the design so that it fits better around the neck 
5 5 we have recently purchased the infant optics dxr 5 and i must say that with all the monitors we have purchased this is by far the best and most reliable monitor we also think that it is very reasonably priced all in all we love it 
5 5 love our amber necklace seems to really work and besides it s absolutely adorable on my son the colors are awesome he has been wearing it for about 4 months now i put it around his ankle at night instead of leaving it around his neck 
5 5 excellent 
4 4 perfect crib for newborns and infants when you want a smaller crib the wood looks great though it does scratch easily i don t think this is unusual for most cribs we used the rocking feature for a very short time and switched to the wheels the wheels are very handy when you want to move the crib around agree with the other reviews that the mattress that it comes with is ridiculous 1 34 maybe we bought a 5 34 mattress also made by davinci and were very happy with it the only difficulty is finding crib sheets that fit as mini crib sheets to fit a 5 34 mattress are difficult to find i ended up finding them through searching amazon reviews on the mattress the one that i found that worked was the luvable friends fitted portable crib sheet 
1 3 came dried out and the applicator was falling apart very cheap and will not buy again
5 5 such a stylish and functional bib perfect for a teething baby one lasts all day which is easier than changing clothes all day super cute patterns i will be buying more for a shower gift 
5 5  i received this product free in exchange for an honest review this was easy to use easy to fill up and worth using the comfort and versability of this product is great for sitting excercising and more this helped with back pain and more the ball provides support with excersices or for sitting the little legs on the ball make it easier to use this is great for any pregnant woman 
5 5 awesome
5 4 very expensive but nice item 
5 5 the washcloths arrived very quickly i was so surprised they are of great quality not super thin so shouldn t wear out anytime soon the best part is that they are so wonderfully soft my son loves them they are a great addition 
5 5 these diapers work well and i highly recommend them 
5 5 i m happy to share my insights on this clever baby carseat cover in blue chevron it s very cute and solidly made the stitching is well done and will stand the test of time it has velcro loops that hold it onto the carseat s handle they include a free 34 stroller hook 34 which is really just a padded carabiner but it is a helpful add i just don t know if it s really the 10 95 value they claim the material is heavy but not too heavy where i worry a baby would feel weighed down the underside is so soft it s as they say plush and lets face it babies love soft fabric the bonafide baby cover will protect the little one from bugs sunlight and even rain for a run between the car and a store house it s available for a great price here on amazon linkthe perfect solution for protecting your baby boy life in a car seat can be tough just when you fall to sleep you re exposed to blinding sunlight flying insects chilly breezes and airborne germs you wouldn t want that and neither does your precious little boy protect him with the infant car seat cover from bonafide baby includes a free stroller hook a 10 95 value conveniently stores your purse diaper bags and more to your stroller shopping carts etc machine washable with a blend of polyester and cotton and a soft plush backside for your baby boy s comfort that also doubles as a blanket the adjustable velcro straps ensure a perfect fit for all brands of cars seats http bonafidebaby com product blue chevron with free strollerhook if this babycarseatcovers review was helpful in any way please let me know using the 34 helpful 34 voting buttons on amazon note i received this product free in exchange for my unbiased review and insights i was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own one may or may not have the same opinion as myself when reading this i am disclosing this in accordance with the federal trade commission s 16 cfr part 255 guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising 34 i received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review 34 this in accordance with the federal trade commission s 16 cfr part 255 guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising 34 i received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review 34 
5 5 best cover ever worth the money no leaks great for predolds and insterts 
5 5 looks good for a potty my toddler girl can successfully use it and it is easy to empty what more could you ask for from a potty chair now if only it could actually teach a toddler to use it 
5 4 i have been using the same pair of tweezers not just same brand for 11 years finally lost mine i wish it took a little more pressure to close them like my last pair but they are fantastic agile accurate tweezers i will use rubis until i die 
5 5 the best made in usa good quality easy to clean bpa free
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers 
5 5 excellent very cute 
1 2 arrived in random ugly colors blue orange not what i expected from the pictures 
5 5 our 16 month old loves her wubbanubs we ve used them since she came home from the hospital these are much easier for her to hold onto and not lose than a regular pacifier the animals make it easier for her to carry them around without dropping the make it easier for mom and dad to spot them and keep track of them at night she loves to cuddle them in her crib meaning she s had no need for a separate security blanket or doll or stuff animal the animals themselves seem to be sewn very well with constant use for 16 months i think only one has started to shown a stitch starting to break as the baby s teeth came in she eventually chewed through some of her oldest most used ones at that point we just took scissors and cut off the pacifier part of those then she still has the ole familiar stuffed animal to play with as a dad i can stuff the animal in my pocket like a handkerchief and leave the pacifier hanging out so it doesn t get nasty these limited edition ones are very cute this is one of those items people stop you in the store to say how adorable they are and wish they had them when they had kids 
5 3 the same type of pacifier they have at the hospital so if you have a baby that only wants the ugly green paci this is a much cuter option 
5 1 don t close well
5 5 mam is the only brand for pacis that i recommend
5 1 it was a gift for my daughter but she sent it back because the package had been opened and it possibly had been used 
5 5 love these pacifiers they are my baby s favorite 
5 5 i love the pacipod keep it clean and i right away know were to look when i am in need of the pacifier
5 5 love the spaces so my son doesn t get a rash on his face from saliva 
5 5 great item
5 3 these pacifiers are well made and if my little guy took a binky longer than a few minutes i bet he d enjoy them however what i don t like is that they re so oddly see through and there s no handle to grab onto 
5 5 my boy likes only these pacifiers 
5 5 i am such a fan of the wubbanub pacifiers the stuffed animal is easy for babies to hold on to even infants plus it s a lot harder to lose a pacifier when it s attached to a stuffed animal i get compliments on our wubbanubs all the time if the stuffed animal part gets really dirty i will toss it in the washer with a load of baby clothes i let it air dry then i wash the pacifier part with dish soap and water very easy 
5 4 i love it this pacifier looks super funny on mu son everybody likes it i dont guve fibe starts because i think is pretty big for new borns 
5 5 i don t leave home without this this is 34 dad s secret weapon 34 when baby gets fussy and i keep it holstered in my back pocket we liked it so much because the stuffed animal allows you to place it in a position that stays in baby s mouf 
5 5 my baby will love this
5 5 super adorable my sweet princess loves it 
5 5 best product i ve bought now have two 
5 5 my baby loves it war eagle 
5 5 adorable
5 1 me too i was expecting 4 as in the photo tricky and also they came in boy colors how can i order specific colors need the pink and purple they should specify 
5 4 my granddaughter loves it
5 5 my granddaughter loves them 
5 3 there is no real difference between these and the less than 3 months model except for how thick these ones are i think this material would be good for shoes she is not a fan because of the lack of chewability 
5 5 thank you
5 5 my infant loves her pacifier she has a hard time holding it in her mouth but that s the only pacifier she likes 
5 4 softest pacifier i have bought so far i have spent a small fortune trying to prevent my baby from becoming a thumb sucker alas this is not the one 
5 5 i m a great grandma that likes to think ahead besides i am handicapped and live six hours away from her and don t travel very far she is only five weeks old but was almost 9 lbs 21 34 long when born these pacifiers are for 6 to 12 month old but i figure she was half grown when born so may be using them at 3 months since they love anything dr brown s and i have bought them a lot of it i know they will love these 
5 5 our baby loves these we ended up buying a different style nipple though just to get her to be flexible she doesn t have a problem switching between the two 
5 5 after i got this bottles i never used any other bottles for already 3 month so easy to clean and my little one loves it too i m not sure if this is because of this bottles but my baby doesn t have any colic from the day i start to use it 
5 1 these pacifiers are to small for the age indicated
5 5 these are life savers for us my toddler has been using them since he was 6 weeks old and has slept through the night ever since he got his first one even as an infant he could put it back in his mouth when it fell out because of the little stuffed animal on the end he now uses them as toys more than pacifiers and absolutely loves them 
5 5 i just recently ordered and received this for my son and he loves it i wish i would have known about these 2 months ago when he was born 
5 5 i know so many of my friends and family like dr brown s anything so since i was ordering some things for my great granddaughter and a friends soon to be born grandson i bought this to put in my box of goodies for when i am invited to a shower etc 
4 5 it is very nice the only thing i wish the site would have given me the option to personalize them 
5 5 my son absolutely loves these pacifiers they smell really nice and seem to calm him down if he is crying 
5 5 wubanub is amazing i bought one more for my kid and three for shower gifts he can now hold onto it and teeth on the feet
5 5 excellent
5 5 these are my baby s favorite they re not too long so he doesn t gag on them like some others i ve tried my first baby would take pretty much any pacifier but my second is much pickier and will only take this kind definitely the easiest to wash out of all of them only negative the nub does make it easy for him to knock out of his own mouth with his flailing hands and arms 
5 5 great value for the money much more expensive in local stores and you only get 2 bottles
5 5 the only binky my newborn will use have stocked up on this 
5 5 i bought this for my future niece after the doctor i work with gave one to his baby love it 
5 5 i can t rave about this product enough it is perfectly designed to stay in baby s mouth and easy for him to grab and put into his mouth himself also easy for mom or dad to find in the crib the middle of the night without turning the lights on from now on i will buy one to attach to the package of every baby shower gift that i give 
5 5 this is the only paci my breastfed daughter wants we love it well worth the money it fits very snug to her face like my breast does while nursing it also seems to stay in her mouth with less work than any silicone pacifier ever did great product we will definitely buy another when this wears out 
4 3 these are ok would be better if it was easy to tie a standard soother clip to it 
5 5 we had received another set of bottles for our newborn son however the hospital provided an mam bottle in our take home bag we tried it and liked it so well we purchased this set we liked the pacifiers so much we purchased some more our son almost never spits up using these bottles they are well designed and so easy to clean we will definitely continue using mam products 
4 4 baby loves it but i wish it were a bit bigger 
5 5 our newborn loves these and won t use our other brands we have
5 5 my newborn grand baby loved these from the start we tried others but she knew the difference 
5 5 what a great idea to attach a toy to a pacifier i was up multiple times at night to fetch for my daughters pacifier this saved the problem 
5 5 great
5 5 just like the one in the hospital 
5 1 cute product but does not arrive with any product information or in a sealed package 
5 5 very nice
5 5 this is still working place in freezer give to my great grandson as needed he s still teething 
5 5 our baby loves these very handy and cute i wish they were made with the orthodontic pacifiers because we need to transiton to those 
5 5 this was my son s favorite character until he met the tiger 
5 5 got this as a gift for our niece she loves it great for babies to find at night in there crib 
4 4 clips easly and prevents falls the only issue is you can t choose the color as it comes at random 
5 4 thanks
5 5 they are awesome because i have tried several and this is the one that has the most space around nose to help baby breath thanks 
3 3 ok
5 5 it s great
5 5 just like the hospital ;)
5 5 good
5 5 we used tomme tippee bottles for my third born my sister is now pregnant and we have gotten her all the tommee tippee closer to nature bottles and now the pacifiers i love that these make the transitions from bottle to pacifier easier and she already loves the brand tomme tippee i received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review 
5 5 love them
5 4 parents loved it 
5 4 my daughter loves these i bought about 6 different kinds and she gagged on them all until i bought this one it s nice and short and thin for their little newborn mouths
5 5 my 7 month old uses this as a teether he is exclusively breastfed and does not use it to suck but he loves it to chew on 
5 5 good
5 5 great item to have for new born he loves this item over other new born pacifiers he is 10 days old and no worries he nurses as well at the hospital they don t suggest new borns to use pacifiers reason may confuse them taking nipples i have no problem and he calms down very easily while i am changing him or putting him to sleep i highly recommend it it doesn t have hole to put pacifier clip on we made a little hole to attach it no problem totally worth the money 
5 5 the only pacifier my lo will take love these
5 5 my baby loves her caterpillar wubbanub she actually likes sucking on the little legs 
5 5 love these for my 2 month old they stay in his little mouth life saver
5 5 my 13 month old son loves the soft silicone pacifiers but the narrow ones were starting to buck out his 2 front teeth these ones are wider and his teeth aligned better after we started using them 
4 5 love the monkey the only bad thing is that it s not detachable to replace but i sewed a new one to it 
3 4 a bit high priced but okay
3 2 we use the soothie pacifier and i couldn t find one that was for older babies i have a fear of her swallowing her pacifier so i thought this would be a good switch b c i always have a hard time finding her pacifier in the night it s good that it glows in the dark but unfortunately i was not successful in getting my baby to switch she cried for the soothie looking at the nipple it s a lot different than the soothie s wish it worked out 
5 1 these need a cut out for baby s nose area they seem uncomfortable for baby and my baby did not take to them
4 4 great little pacifiers that are similar to the soothies but supposed to stay closer to the babies face so they slip out less i can t say whether they actually do slip out less seems about the same the only thought i have is that they cut a little low on the babies lip so part of the lip is sticking over the pacifier the feeling would annoying me but i guess doesn t seem to bother the baby too much
5 5 the only paci that my 3 week old son will actually suck on it has to be the vanilla since we bought some at another store same ones with no vanilla scent these are the ones the hospital here gives out to new mommies newborns i wanted a couple extra i just wish they would scent the ones for older babies just in case we may need them 
5 5 love em
5 5 i buy these all the time as gifts they are such cute little things and are always high quality this one was no exception it also came with a product tag that had safety and cleaning information which is nice for new parents i plan on buying many more in the future 
5 5 than you good product
5 5 best pacifier ever 
5 5 my baby s favorite paci toy in one the horns are great for little baby hands to hold on to great for our little texas baby :)
3 5 only thing that my picky baby would take she s 100 breast milk fed but will take it from a bottle however she wouldn t touch a paci until we find this she had a tongue tie revised and a significant upper lip tie maybe related maybe not 
5 5 i bought this for my niece my sister says hands down it was the best baby gift she received my niece loves it she likes to suck on the pacifier and playing with the soft texture of the giraffe plus the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to sit nicely in her mouth when she s laying down ordering a second one :)
4 1 nice but aterrizar a week of use the drawing almost vanished it is a pity 
5 5 a diaper bag essential for the mom on the go great for teethers toys and pacifiers 
5 5 these are so cute highly recommend for the babe helps keep it from falling to the floor 
5 5 the baby loves these we weren t too sure about the glow in the dark gimmick but it s been really helpful at night when the baby drops it and starts to fuss their easy to find in a dark room without having to turn on the lights and wake all of us up 
5 5 my grandson loves to sleep with wubbanub i recommend it 
5 4 fast shipping not dependable for heavy support 
5 5 works perfect with the stroller 
5 5 amazing camera great battery life if you let it drain all the way before charging it again zoom feature fantastic for first time parents is he breathing the push to talk button is easy to accidentally push but it doesn t seem to matter it s so worth the peace of mind 
5 5 super handy umbrella stroller folds compactly and is comfortable for toddlers to ride it 
5 5 worked well and my friend installed it easily 
5 5 mam is the only brand of pacifier that our eight month old will accept we ve tried nuk avent and several other brands this is the only thing that will help him calm down when he s in distress or simply ready for a nap 
5 5 my niece has 3 puppies and i am babysitting this week i am trying your playpen inside before taking the puppies outside i am happy to watch the little puppies i have two large dogs and rescued them as adults this eekend will determine if i should get a puppy or a new resue animal for my house this is great
5 4 these pins work satisfactorily so far they have not rusted 
5 5 works pretty well many waiters and waitresses comment how thankful they are that we attempt to keep our little ones mess to a minimum we also get a lot of people commenting how interesting it looks i normally just shake the food off while at a restaurant and then wash it off at home and let it air dry i think it s a great product 
3 3 it served it s purpose but the fit made my breast look weird and it was easy to fall out of not a bra that can be worn the whole day if you have large breast 
5 4 already some of the stitching is coming undone on the handles but i like the price and the size for a diaper bag it also looks nicer the colors than many others i ve seen the body material easily wipes clean which is very necessary 
5 5 very nice
5 5 soft adorable my daughter loves it 
5 5 amazing natural product i used it on my baby for 2 months and its fabulous he has smooth skin rash is gone it also moisturises extremelty well my baby loves it thank you 34 la petite crme 34 happy baby happy mommy 
4 4 this is a nicely sized versatile play gym you can set it up so it s a cozy four sided play area for a newborn or you can open up all the sides for an older baby so he or she can move around and explore the toys can be attached to the arches the tummy time pillow or the play mat itself these included rattles and toys for this play gym are decent quality i particularly like the teething leaves the giraffe and the monkey rattle the light up elephant that plays music is cute the elephant can also be attached to a car seat although i m not a fan of the idea of attaching a hard plastic toy on the handle of the infant carrier overall this is a good and versatile baby activity gym it s a much better quality than the fisher price moonlight gym i also reviewed recently the sunny safari theme is gender neutral so it s a good pick for first time moms who hope to use it for more than one child 
5 5 its a good size bag my baby is too young for the carrier so i have not try out that feature yet the yellow is more highlighter yellow than the orange yellow in the picture also even though the item says bliss the item shipped is the delux if you don t mind yellow its a great deal
4 2 i rarely write a review but i m hoping this might prompt the company to change the photo yes it s true if you read the fine print it says the price is for one however the photo shows two and it is very deceptive the item is overpriced for a single bed rail and now i m forced to buy another one 
5 5 worked well
5 5 just got my son s necklace today he recently turned one and after suffering through teething and with 4 more teeth coming in at once i thought it was time he got his first teething necklace so far he hasn t tried to pull it off or break it he actually pushes me away when i try to take it off lol i m going to give it a few days and see if it helps with his teeth :)
5 5 amazing i bought this 8 years ago went thru two grand d loved it all wore great ordered additional items from theme also 
5 4 our grandson spends the night twice a week and he has outgrown the pack and play we received the crib at 4 pm and had it together by 4 30 pm my wife official family instruction reader and i have put together lots of furniture office being the hardest this was a breeze instructions were clear pieces where marked it is sturdy and for the price you can t beat it i only gave it a four since we only just got it 
1 1 it did not come like the picture it s not aqua gray and white it s all gray and white i waited a longtime for this item and i m very disappointed 
5 5 this is cute double sided and works well it s not super heavyweight so if there s a big gust of wind it might blow up but i like that it s light enough for me to know my baby can breathe well under it it also washes great i like that if i have a boy later on i could swap the sides and the red white pattern is more gender nuetral 
4 4 great overall stroller especially if you have or are expecting 2 kids however it is very heavy we only use it when i m husband is around otherwise wife takes the el cheapo umbrella stroller which is 11 lbs when she s going out with the baby by herself if i had to do it again i would probably have bought 3 cheap lightweight umbrella strollers to keep at each of the grandparents our home replace them as needed however would still have needed a full size heavy duty stroller when your kid is still an infant this stroller works with the britax infant car seat if you get the adapter for 20 hopefully will have a 2nd child so we can use this stroller to it s full potential get our money s worth 
4 2 love the color it s a little bit too short even though i ordered a bigger size still a little small
5 5 if you are expecting a baby know someone who is or have a new grandchild due and want something at your house for those short visits buy one of these this is so soft and comfy for baby a friends baby had colic and she said it seemed to help it is a very gentle rocking motion and also vibrates if you want when my daughter finally got to bring her micro preemie home she had to stay with me for a couple of months for medical reasons i brought one of these home so we would have a place in the living room for the baby but not down where the dogs could get in his face like in a bouncy seat she wasn t sure about it until it was put together and she placed her precious child in it all smiles from everyone it was then in the dining room doorway to the kitchen in the hall outside the bathroom while she did her hair get the picture lol much more portable than a pack n play or bassinet so give it a try 
5 5 my son started teething and he needed something to help relieve it the package arrived quickly and i put it on him as soon as we got home by the next morning i notice a difference in his behavior he still drools and likes to chew on things but not nearly as much as he was before his overall fussiness had improved as well the necklace was of very high quality and i love the way it looks on him 
5 5 nicer than i expected for the price soft and stretchy 
5 5 we love the infant optics dxr 5 for the price for 100 it works great and the picture quality is pretty good we like how quickly and easily it transitions to night vision when needed the set up is easy and the device is intuitive we re planning on taking it on all of our trips this year the one thing that could be improved is the range of the monitor camera the signal drops out every once in a while but not consistently overall great product for the price and we recommend it 
5 3 the characters go with eric carle but not with the book cute for the bath tho
1 1 not steady very cheap quality
5 5 my son loves it
5 5 we love these bibs so easy to clean and ready for use again not bulky though sometimes awkward with small babies perfect for about 8 9 mos and up perfect for restaurants because you can put them back in your bag clean no more washing bibs in the laundry or waiting for bibs to cycle back through or having a huge stack just wipe and put back on the hi chair for next time definitely recommend 
5 3 i bought this mobile for my baby cause the other one he had broke well u know what they say u get what u pay for i have a budget and this was affordable and it gives my baby something to be looking at shile he s in the crib it is plain and nice for 20
5 5 great toy for curious little hands 
5 4 i really like this bed set but the sheet it comes with is such a busy pattern it hurts my eyes other than the sheet it s wonderful 
5 3 didn t hold the food in very well and my daughter hated sticking her hands in it so i had to use it without the cap on 
5 5 great product works perfect for the bed for out toddler queen size bed 
5 4 we love this backseat organizer made from logiclux it has a neat and simple design that makes it easy to install and use as well it has plastic hooks at the end of the long straps attached on the top bottom of the organizer that helps to secure the backseat organizer it has deeper and different sizes of pockets to accommodate more objects in the car it is crafted from quality materials which assures that various pockets and tightly stitched straps won t tear by the stress brought on by the array of objects since it is detachable it can be removed when not needed the backseat car organizer s solid pockets are not only ideal for arranging kids items but it is also perfect for holding sanitizers coupons calculators notepads etc i m very much satisfied with this logiclux backseat car organizer it s really great for the busy mom on the go or anyone trying to keep their car more organized and have the items you need readily accessible i love this product and would definitely recommend to others i am glad to be a part of the promo to test and provide my unbiased reviews
4 4 the socks are very soft and my 2 year old seems to like them overall they seem like great socks i m docking a star due to the misleading picture i bought 3 packs of these socks and the white socks with pink hearts and pink toe heals are not included i ve uploaded a picture showing what socks you ll actually be getting i still like what came but just disappointed that i didn t get what was pictured as those socks are what made me decide to purchase this pack also included picture of materials and product label 
1 1 these don t work the first one we bought worked but the other two just slide right on open when the slightest amount of pressure is applied doesn t even keep our one year old out very expensive little items and hard to install to end up not working even a little bit 
5 5 my grandchild loves it :)
5 5 love it very soft and breathable 
5 5 good
5 5 this gate works perfectly for the top of our stairs i followed the directions that came with the gate and it took about 30 minutes to put it up it is very sturdy even when my little one about 30 inches tall tries to climb up it which he can t and tries to shake open the gate 
5 5 good for what i needed 
5 5 i love this carseat it s easy to install and seems very safe we used to have the diono radian and fit barely fit in the back of our small suv this seat fits better because it has a lot of recline room and it s very easy to figure out how to use the it the first radian we had was heavy and har for me to install i read the instructions twice and still had trouble remembering things and working with it then we got the advocate as a second seat because we use different cars a lot i loved this seat so much i sold the first seat and got another advocate the radian was not a bad car seat it just didn t work for my family the advocate is a lot wider and takes up a lot more room but i love it 
5 1 these cups are not spill proof try playtex
5 5 my granddaughter loves it so that means i love it 
5 5 this is the second one i have bought and they both have had a lot of good use and would buy another for a gift anytime
5 1 although these fit my medela pump in style advanced they had very poor suction i would suggest sticking with the medela brand valves and membranes 
5 5  videoid e718ad4e25e6a2a86536d7bffbfbf6ab bought this as a gift for my friend who is 23 weeks pregnant this video shows her using it and her feedback 
1 1 i m very unhappy with this stroller hook during the first use it broke and now just hangs open and no longer latches nothing was done to it no excessive force used to cause this it only had one lightweight bag on it i do not recommend this product 
5 5 really cute fits well 
5 5 everything i thought it would be it will be a perfect addition for a future daughter 
5 4 these are really great for babies and toddlers like to feed themselves our only issue has been that the to these are really great for babies and toddlers like to feed themselves our only issue has been that the lid became slightly deformed when we dish wash that on the top rack since the lid shape changed a little bit it does not hold snacks and well and can no longer be tossed in the diaper bag when we are ready to go for fear of spilling 
5 5 very secure and not too unattractive i thought we could skip over having one of these things or find something less obtrusive but knowing what i now know i wouldn t just get this one and be done with it 
5 3 good for a 2yr old
5 5 its really nice
2 3 wonderful until it ripped after a couple months i will still use it but it has ripped along 3 of the stars shown in the pic 
5 5 i love the pouches several reasons 1 they have a lid not an annoying zip close 2 they lay flat to freeze or refrigerate 3 they can be used for milk or food 4 nothing to wash or sanitizei would also recommend the bottle food warmer
1 1 what seemed like a potty training essential at first now appear to be fairly useless it will take us a millennium to go through them i think 
5 5 i love this i bought it so we could do a nighttime formula feeding without any hassle it s great it s easy to assemble and disassemble and very easy to use works great and my baby loved it my husband was able to do a nighttime feeding and i got to sleep 
5 5 i love these got one for my now 3 year old and she used it for forever it helped keep the pack in her mouth and later she just loved it for the animal bought this one thinking my newest addition would enjoy it too but she s just not a pack baby 
1 1 these are really cheaply made after installing them all i found that most of the catches either the hook part or the eye part or both broke when i tried gently to open the drawers to test them they are hard and brittle maybe i got a defective batch but there is no way i would even buy this brand again 
5 5 so cute and pretty the light pink beads on the top wings don t show up as much in real life as it does in the photo but i still love it for my little girl s room 
5 4 i love this perfect fit for my daughter
5 5 i have tried 6 different types of bottles for my breast fed baby she suffers from gas so i wanted to try the anti gas colic bottles and a bottle that was as close to breast feeding as possible this was not an easy task so here is the break down of the 6 different bottles from my favorite to my least favorite tommee tippee sensitive tummiespros natural shaped nipple good tubed venting system jaw mechanics close to breast feedingcons lots of parts to clean no disc between bottle and nipplemunchkin latchpros good bottom venting system natural shaped nipple jaw mechanics close to breast feeding milk comes out of the nipple usually only when baby is suckingcons baby had difficult time latchingdr brownpros good tubed venting systemcons not natural shaped nipple doesn t have same mechanics as breast feeding lots of parts to clean born free pros good venting systemcons air kept squeaking in the corners of my babies mouth during feeding average shaped nipple faster flow than other slow flowphillips aventpros natural shaped nipple with cutouts to make the nipple more pliablecons not very good venting system i had to keep burping during the feeding lanisoh mommapro natural shaped nipplecon terrible venting system worst of the bunch baby was up till 3am with gas pain i really wanted my baby to like the munchkin bottle the best it seemed to have the closest to breastfeeding mechanics of the bunch 
5 3 good
5 5 my granddaughter even she is 9 yr old still love dinosairs and its really hard to find dcor for this age group and specialy for girls this product really brought nice 34 dino 34 touch lol she is happy and so do i 
5 5 i absolutely love it i like how its the perfect length my daughter was less irritable after having it on for a period of time and drooled way less i would definitely recommend to other moms especially to those who are curios about the amber necklaces 
5 5 beautiful and so soft 
5 5 safe 
5 5 love
5 5 chair arrived and was assembled easily child loves it 
5 5 excellent and beautiful 
5 5 i ve been using an amber necklace for the past 18 months with my son people often ask me if i think it makes a difference and it s hard to say for sure since he s too young to tell me but it definitely hasn t had a negative effect he s been a fairly easy teether and i do believe it has helped plus i like how it looks it didn t take him long to forget he was wearing it and other than occasionally putting it in his mouth he doesn t mess with it it s a good length short enough not to catch on things but easily long enough to be comfortable i bought this one as a baby gift for a friend and i know she s looking forward to using it as soon as her little guy starts teething :)
5 4 i really like being able to store all of the diapering items in one smaller bag the quick works great for people who do disposable we do cloth and i do find the bag a bit too narrow to accommodate more than 2 diapers wish i could fit three in here that said we can fit 2 applecheeks size 2 diapers a wet bag a travel size of wipes and a small tube of diaper cream 
5 5 all good
3 3 i find that it works but it s a lot of effort and takes a lot of time just to pump a few ounces at times i feel like it would be and usually is just as effective to hand express good for an emergency but maybe would not purchase again knowing i could do it with my own hands as effectively 
5 5 this shield fits perfect on my chicco keyfit 30 does a nice job of shielding the baby from sun and insects haven t figured out how to fold it back up though 
5 5 i bought this for my friend who just had a baby and she loves it it s made of steel instead of plastic so it doesn t smell it s taller so it s more ergonomic and it came in the perfect color to match the decor of her nursery highly recommend 
5 5 it s perfect for my son he is 2 years old and love his potty 
5 5 the tommee tippee bottles seem to be working really well for my baby since it is really close to when i feed him there isn t a huge shock factor for him the shape of the bottle also helps with holding on in the day or night looks good and works well 
2 2 my wife doesn t like this because she said is too hard 
1 5 this mouthpiece has completely stopped my snoring i really thought it was a waste of money but believe me it works i have not snored since i have been wearing it it does take a while to get use to and has made my jaw sore for a week or so but totally worth it 
5 5 i was devestated when i couldn t produce enough breast milk and making bottles at midnight wasn t very much fun we decided to splurge with a gift card and get this it is a luxury not a necessity but it saves a lot of time and it really is as easy as pushing a button and bam bottle done in 5 seconds we haven t had any problems with it after a month 
5 2 i bought these for my daughter to use for her baby because i had used evenflo angled bottles with her when she was born they were great they re not so great these days the base of nipples never fit snug in the rim maybe it s the strange notch on them now i just know that they leak every bottle i bought her is leaking the nipples collapse several times during each feeding bring back the 1994 design 
4 5 great car seat especially when it is hot only complaint is small straps need more length 
5 5 great quality very big my 2 year old son loves it 
5 5 cutest thermos ever keeps my fruit salad cool and my soup warm for hours and looks adorable makes working thru lunch fun almost 
5 5 i purchased this for my wife who was always complaining about our messy car and now she s so happy and absolutely loves it it s super spacious good quality material and has done a great job protecting the leather car seat from our very energetic boy s kicking feet 
5 5 love this crib my daughters share a room so we did not have the space for a full size crib i was a little hesitant to purchase this based on some of the poor reviews i read but since it was the only one really in our price range i gave it a shot boy i was not disappointed it s the perfect size cute and has held up very well i purchased the dream on me 3 34 mattress to go with it since the mattress that is included is so ridiculous :)
5 5 nice breathable material i like the 34 lip 34 part of the cover which allows me to see my baby and provides ventilation 
5 5 5month old baby likes this very much 
5 5 i have a little one just starting to teeth and he likes to grab things but i also work full time in a professional setting and feel comfortable wearing this for work and weekend play time really well made and very pretty 
5 5 love it 
5 5 granddaughter loves it
2 2 if you have a weak kid then these might work but my kid was able to pull 2 of these off in a matter of 24 hours 
4 3 the gate is very solid the installation is straightforward but i ran into a couple of issues if you have quarter round or other detailed molding right at the ground you ll need to remove some of it to get the bracket to mount properly the gate can compensate for having baseboard but the bottom bracket sits right on the floor and mounts to the wall so you need a flat surface on your wall doorway at the bottom i suspect this isn t a problem for most doorways but mine was going in an entry way that had quarter round a couple of minutes with a chisel took care of it but i will have to repair my molding once i remove the gate despite measuring leveling etc i have a problem with the gate easily closing it seems like the gate door is slightly out of plane with the rest of the unit i m sure the gate works perfectly in houses with perfectly square walls and careful installation but i think the latches need to provide a bit more slop as it is i need to use care or sometimes two hands to get the door to align and close properly the gate is very nice compared to the expandable wood type specifically if you need something that will stand up to a baby playing around it but if i need another in the future i ll be looking for one with a better latching system and a wider door opening 
5 5 good
5 3 i loved this bag for about a year but after that it started to fall apart the strap broke and the condition of the bag just looked very worn i d recommend it if you want a nice looking diaper bag with lots of space and pockets etc but don t expect it to last more than a year 
5 2 looks like a plain cheap umbrella 
5 5 perfect as described and super quick delivery
5 5 i love these pillow cases they are pretty soft and sturdy just what i wanted 
5 5 worth every dollar my baby boy loves it and i have more time to do things while he plays in it i think we all moms can agree that we sometimes don t even have time to eat soo it is so important that baby can play by himself i also put lot of his toys on the table so its more interesting for him we bought it when he was 5 months old and now his 8 months you can adjust the seat when baby grows 
5 4 easy to use
4 4 the only thing i wish it had was a longer visor on top to give more shade otherwise it works just fine 
1 1 one day old and the back started making squeaky noice i have tried reassembling it but still the same its too big to send it back stuck with the squeaky noice 
4 4 bag securely fit car seat and rope was able to tighten completely covering car seat i checked this item it stayed securely closed however it did have a few minor scratch holes on bag at the end of flight
5 3 this barely fits on our bob duallie pro 
5 1 these cloth diapers are the worst they shrunk about 2 inches and turned into a wrinkled mess after just the first wash i use these for burp cloths i have no idea how you would use them as diapers i bought the toys r us brand and they are amazing toys r us brand doesn t shrink at all they keep their shape and they are sewn much better even after many washes do not buy these gerber brand right vs toys r us brand in the photo 
5 4 cheaply made but provides everything you need for a newborn if you want more better quality of what you want be advised to purchase them seperately 
5 5 these are great and come with lids for all 3 bowl sizes similar bowls by munchkin used to come with all 3 lids but now only come with 1 lid for the smallest bowl 
2 2 cheap looking and a lot smaller then i thought 
5 5 we started with medela bottles then tommy tippee and finally got a free mam from our ob the nipple shape is very easy for my son to latch on to and they seem to help a bit with gas 
5 5 my baby loves these so i buy them for every baby shower gift 
5 4 we like it b c its funny but even my baby likes it great pics that will definitely embarrass my kid when he s 16 
5 5 my child loved this pacifier it gave him something to fiddle with while trying to go to sleep 
5 5 so cute and worth the money my daughter hates regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she likes plus she can hold onto the little lamb
5 5 great product that becomes your child s go to pacifier i ve bought several over the years one even fell apart and the company stood behind their product and helped me to replace it thanks wubbanub 
5 5 i love these pacifiers my daughter hays regular pacifiers and these are the only ones she will use we have 3 now and i just adore the giraffe is so cute when she is holding it would recommend
5 5 excelent
5 5 i love this perfect for my month old she can hold it easily and its so cute 
5 5 best pacifiers ever and they glow in the dark which rules because my kids have always been able to find them in the crib never had that problem of baby looking for paci and not finding it in the dark never ever so grateful one less reason to wake up in the middle of the night 
3 4 a little smaller than i was expecting could maybe fit two pacifiers depending on the brand but we usually only fit one in it is tight to open which is good if you re clipping it on the outside of a bags but does make for opening it with one hand rather difficult if you re holding a child 
5 5 my daughter loves her wubbanubs we have 3 different ones 
5 5 best pacifiers out there my kids loved these bought tons and tone
5 5 my first baby didn t like pacifers so the second time around i didn t give them much thought i put these on my wish list as an after thought boy was i wrong about that these might be the number one used baby product in our house besides maybe mybreastfriend feeding pillow that thing is magic i m super glad i thought to add them to my registry 
5 5 my picky baby loves these prefect for a breastfed baby plus i had these same pacifiers as a baby it s nostalgic to see my own little one with them they smell sweet but not fake sweet and can hold up to being chewed on 
5 5 as good as i expected our 13mons daughter still needs her wubbanub to fall asleep n we bought it to replace the old ones this duckie is very cute better than her first two wubbanubs which r a pink elephant n a giraffe
5 5 we have 3 wubbanubs and i foresee many more in the future our son loves holding onto the animals we have the monkey giraffe and elephant 
5 5 i got this for a new mom to be as a baby shower gift it is super cute and everyone loved it including the new mom to be she can t wait to use it it is a wonderful invention and i wish i had it for my kids i can t wait to see it in action with my friend s baby it s a perfect baby shower gift 
5 5 we love our wubbanub it s great for little fingers which are still gaining their motor skills it s easy for babies to grab and put in their mouths when they have the dexterity to do so it s also easier for newbies to knock out of their mouths if their arms move around while they sleep we swaddled so didn t really have this problem 
5 2 great looking and feels high quality but my child will never keep it in his mouth because it is shaped strangely he hates the feel of the dummy in his mouth 
5 5 good product good for the baby durable 
5 5 it s a mute button for my baby
5 5 hilarious 
1 1 broke during 1st nap time use very dissapionted
5 5 purchased two of these one for my son who had a preemie and one for my friend as a baby gift i had a womb sound bear years ago for my own son who was had colic and found it to work for me hope it works for them too 
5 5 great paci holder keeps pacis and teethers small ones clean when out and about ;)
5 5 my son loves them and refuses to go back to his old pacifiers 
1 1 i specifically purchased these for the glow in the dark feature and they don t glow in the dark i returned the first set thinking i received a defective pair but the replacement didn t glow either 
5 5 super helpful in holding the paci in the newborn s mouth i used this along with the swaddle sometimes i d wrap a burp cloth around the animal body and the baby to make sure the paci didn t fall out in the middle of the nap i know mother of the year over here my now six month old still uses the wubbanub as a toy he likes to gnaw on the paci and animal body for fun 
5 5 love these it makes them so easy to find in the middle of the night thank you mam for making such amazing products 
5 5 my baby loves these pacis he had trouble keeping the soothie pacis in his mouth when he was a newborn so we tried these they were an instant improvement he is able to keep them in his mouth much more easily and they have good ventilation holes so he hasn t developed any rash they also come with a little plastic cover which is great forkeeping the pacis clean i should also note that this is my first child that has preferred a paci to the thumb so at first i was nervous that the paci would mess with breastfeeding after a lot of research we tried the avent free flow and we haven t had any issues with breastfeeding so far baby is currently 4 months old i highly recommend them 
5 5 great baby loves
5 5 just like they used in the hospital baby loves them 
3 4 it s decent but i feel like sometimes the stuffed animal weighs it down and out my daughters mouth 
5 5 my baby love them 
5 5 keeps the baby happy 
5 4 my son kept losing his binky in his crib this helps so much could be a bit more better quality but it works 
5 5 love it
5 5 the regular nuk pacifiers gagged my newborn daughter but these 0 2 month pacifiers suited my baby just fine 
5 5 gr eat
5 2 should have looked at some reviews and believed them i got ny mets and the picture has them in what looks like at plastic case and an orange stripe on pacifier the ones i got were blister packed and no orange stripe i really got these because of the otange strioe as i had seen the solid blue ones before but loved this design so if you like this pacifuer design be warned it ll come all blue and blister packed as this was a gift they look cheaper than pictured 
5 5 both are little ones love these 
5 5 both are little ones love these 
5 5 these pacifiers really do glow in the dark i have them sitting out in the kitchen where the lights are on and off throughout the day so it s not like they are getting direct light all the time to charge the glow is strong enough so you can find them in the crib but slight enough that it doesn t bother baby who is trying to fall asleep so around 3 am after 8 hours of sitting in a dark crib i can still find these things and pop it in baby s mouth and then baby just drifts off to sleep ha not really but these paci s do help baby has been using these since he was 2 months old and is now 6 months 
5 5 the only pacifier my baby will use the little plush animal helps her hold it and this one almost never gets lost like the other once 
5 5 i cannot say enough about these pacifiers my sons loved them neither baby would take anything else we tried various options even some that were very similar they were not fooled they had to have the gumdrop pacifiers they have both since been weaned easier than i thought but i buy them for all of our friends and their babies love them too you can buy the vanilla scented ones from the hospital nursery the scent goes away in a few weeks 
1 3 my son loved this pacifier until the tip broke off out of nowhere thankfully not while it was in his mouth we had 2 of these and even the second one that had not broken had lines where you could tell it was worn and could break at any time i contacted the company but received no response after reading the box it states to change the pacifier every 6 8 weeks which of course we hadn t it had been 5 months with 2 pacifiers so apparently natural rubber isn t the strongest material 
2 2 i like how thin the bag is it doesn t take up much space and dries very nicely however after only a short period of time using it approximately twice a week for 3 5 months the drawstring does not work very well it gets caught on the material and is difficult to just pull close this is going to become a back up wet bag and i m going to by another one of the brand that works well for me 
5 4 a lot softer than a soothe paci but my lo preferred her soothe
1 1 not impressed
5 5 these are really cute and they stand out a bit from the same old every day pacifier perfect for sports fans and they also match lots of little outfits these are definitely a win at our house 
4 4 wish the pacifier would come out so i could wash the lamb 
5 5 my son loves this and my husband loves that it s a dragon 
5 5 love these 
5 4 these are a nice alternative to the silicone paci daughter still wouldn t take it but she did chew on it more than others 
5 5 love it
5 5 awesome little man loves it 
3 3 okay in a pinch just not the pacifier our little one prefers the handle on the front adds extra weight which our little ones didn t like they come in a self containing case so i keep them in the diaper bag as a backup she has used mam pacifiers the most it all comes down to personal preference 
5 4 this diaper bag is eye popping chipper and very trendy the first thing i noticed were snap on nylon straps so i can attach this to a stroller the only thing i ll need to keep in mind is not to overload the ecosusi that wouldn t be very hard to do because there are so many pockets to tuck things in including two little lined containers that match the bag i can use one for a bottle the other for a pacifier it s one of those diaper bags that was more than likely one in which they consulted mothers on it has all the features i like to see in a bag there are synthetic zippers which are easier to work and metal zipper pulls the hardware is a mix of metal and plastic the one vulnerability i see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap the material is waterproof 600d nylon something i see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag the design is new generation stylish but with an old fashioned dollop of fun i like it s a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone the inside of the bag s design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets zippered elasticized and simple i definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy there s a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if you re walking around the ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers a change of clothes snacks and other essentials needed for a small excursion i do have stroller straps i can use to hook this diaper bag on my graco for quick access as i mentioned in does have those snap on nylon straps if you don t have one it does have 1 1 2 nylon straps so i can swing it over my shoulder or if i prefer i can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles diaper bags aren t carried for long periods of time like backpacks and similar to my other one the padding is lacking in the straps rather par for the course in the diaper bag line unless you re willing to buy something rather pricey pockets pockets pockets changing pad extra containers metal zipper pulls and on and on i do love this bag and i love the chipper design it s quite roomy and has those little extras that make it quite appealing i would have preferred metal hardware but the plastic is heavy and probably impact resistant very nice stylish ultra functional diaper bag that will come in handy sample provided for review in the straps rather par for the course in the diaper bag line unless you re willing to buy something rather pricey pockets pockets pockets changing pad extra containers metal zipper pulls and on and on i do love this bag and i love the chipper design it s quite roomy and has those little extras that make it quite appealing i would have preferred metal hardware but the plastic is heavy and probably impact resistant very nice stylish ultra functional diaper bag that will come in handy sample provided for review 
5 5 they really do glow it s easy to find when he fusses at night :)
3 5 good product but my son doesn t think so 
5 5 these rock glow in the dark pacifiers are the way to go if you don t have any you should try them no more turning the light on to find it 
5 1 i have a boy what is the logic for receiving a girl pacifier well i got fooled by the ad amazon needs take out this offer it doesn t make sense 
5 4 my daughter loves these pacifiers my only complaint is the nipple sometimes gets water trapped inside from washing and i have to work to get it out 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my 7 week old likes i kept trying to give her the green avent ones the hospital sent us home with and the think the nipple part is just too big for her tiny mouth to enjoy this one is very thin and fits perfectly between her tongue and the top of her mouth it seems when she s fussy from exhaustion we try to give her this and if that s the actual cause of her fussiness she takes it and is often instantly asleep 
4 5 these are the only pacifiers my daughter likes at the moment i like the different colors they sell too im not into pink much so my daughter doesnt wear a lot of pink mostly neutrals or purple she gets called a boy often but with these pacifiers now she doesnt haha my only problem with these is that because they dont have an open handle like most pacifiers do you have to be careful what paicfier clip to buy because some are thick and meant to be used on the hard plastic pacis but luckily they make paci holders that have a small string to just draw thru 
5 5 my baby loves it 
5 5 authentic merchandise original packaging and quick shipping great buy 
5 5 perfect
5 5 the best thing ever love it 
5 5 my son loves the mams pacifiers these are the one kind that he keeps in his mouth love the glow in the dark feature helps us locate it during the night will and have bought over and over again
5 5 great product my 3 month old liked this style better than a few of the other styles out there i will be ordering more 
5 5 this is great it hangs right in the strap of baby s diaper bag and fits two pacifiers sono always have one handy it s also cute i was able to match the color to the diaper bag colors i love that i don t have to dig for pacifiers or clean them when i find them at the bottom of the bag 
1 1 the item i received is not the item i ordered the one pictured shows a separate syringe and separate medicine dispenser where the baby could suck as you push the medicine in or you could just have the medicine part separate so they can just suck on it like a pacifier but i really wanted to be able to leave the syringe in so the medicine only goes to the nipple and not the surrounding areas like other medicine dispsensers i have the munchkin one and meds get trapped around the rim the one i recieved is an all in one that i could buy at any walmart target etc i wanted the one pictured because it is separate and easier to dose small amounts the one i received is a white syringe with a clear pacifier nipple and the smallest dose amount you can dose out in it is 2 5ml i need one to be able to dose 1 25ml so this one is not even one i would order in the first place also the nipple part of this is hard as a rock no way an infant would find this appropriate to suck on and effectively get the medicine so disappointed i wanted the mini medicator pictured here and did not get that 
5 4 i m glad i found soothies in different colors i wish they sold these in two packs because i didn t need four but i suppose i will always have spares in the future if i need them 
5 5 glow in the dark what a great concept who ever thought of this is a genius makes finding the lost paci easy for my little one so i don t have to get up and do it for him love love love 
5 5 works well and is as cute as could be lol
5 5 wubbanubs are a lifesaver they are one of the best baby products out there 
5 5 mr monkey 
5 4 love the wubbanub binkies the puppy is adorable and it wears well my only negative comment is that there is no way to remove the binkie from the dog if you wanted to just wash sanitize the binkie otherwise adorable take on binkies my son loves to play with the dog and use the pacifier 
3 1 the body of the caterpillar has small mold spots i feel like the pacifier should be able to come off the body in order to give it a proper wash 
5 2 my baby hates this design so i had to try another brand i m sure they re fine for some babies basically just try a variety and see which ones your little one prefers 
5 5 life saver this was our 2nd one as the first one was lost i had to order one quick it got to me in a decent amount of time happy to say its still with us survived the dog thinking it was a toy for her i will definitely recommend this to friends consider it as a gift at baby showers for any first time parent reading one reason why these are great is because it helps the pacifer stay put huge lifesaver when you just want some sleep but that darn pacifer keeps popping out much easier to find at night too ;)
5 5 our absolute favorite pacifiers 
5 5 this is the only pacifier that my daughter would use she started teething at 2 months and she was just in hell i felt so helpless and tried at least a dozen pacifiers until she liked the wubbanub it s perfect the plush toy gives her something to play with the natural nipple was a plus easy for her to latch on to my little one takes it out of her mouth to curls up with it in her crib and go to sleep instead of the others that she threw on the ground with a look of disdain on her face 
5 5 the cutest thing call my youngest grandchild monkey so this was perfect it was her security item now that she has been weaned from the pacifier we cut the pacifier off and she still lugs the monkey part around with her
5 5 love these for the little guy have about 1 dozen around the house and have been buying them for our parents houses now 
5 2 this crib liner is too big for a regular crib also the ties that are supposed to hold the walls up don t grip to anything and just slide down therefore defeating the whole purpose of the liner not happy with this purchase 
5 5 these are light weight and great as our place gets steaming hot the closer it gets to summer we were also looking for something to swaddle our 6 month old in that was easier to break out of when he wants to than the strong velcro type so we can transition out of the swaddle entirely would have loved the 4th blanket to not just be plain white though 
5 5 absolutely love this stroller so far it maneuvers so easily the simpelest assembly my 3 year old has room to grow and it is so light folding it down is very easy as well once you figure it out the first time i am so happy i didn t spend the extra money on a bigger brand name i did not buy this for running or jogging so i cannot attest to that but for errands and outings perfect 
5 3 received diaper bag gift no comment 
5 5 very good
5 5 great for the price 
5 5 best changing pad great price 
5 5 these cups are great for the toddler who wants to use a straw cup on his own but also likes to throw it around the lid attaches tightly no leaks we reuse these bought them over a month ago and still using the same set 
5 5 love how large this is for bigger noses this is perfect for my 3 year old when he gets stuffy and needs some help getting his sinuses cleared gentle and effective it has great suction too easily cleaned and assembled disassembled i would buy this again the 1 oz size is for babies 
5 5 this net is large enough to hold a lot of stuffed animals very easy to install great product 
5 5 i absolutely love these i had a friend that gave me some as a gift for my toddler and infant i have been unable to locate these so i saw this being offered for a review so i jumped for them not only have i used them but i also wanted them so it worked great it is hard locating spoons that a toddler will like and an infant will like neither one likes metal in their mouth nor do they care for that hard plastic that cuts their mouth these spoons are great safe and easy to clean i am not sure who loves them more me or them 
5 5 best highchair i searched for weeks and finally landed on this graco chair it is comfortable for my son and easy to clean 
5 4 easy to assemble and light though the mattress does not lay completely flat they should sell crib sheets to specifically fit this bed 
5 5 very useful good product 
5 5 way cute but really small using for a baby shower game
5 5 great seat it is a seat that will work from birth on up and up and up some of the features make it quite convenient such as the rear facing recline position that makes it work for infants and the adjustable head piece that eliminates the need to remove the cover and re thread the seatbelt as the child grows as well as making it last much longer by keeping it safe and comfortable for tall children this is good value for money the sapphire color is bright and works well for girls or boys the seat isn t overly cushy but it seems safe comfortable and of sturdy material 
5 4 excelente
5 3 this is not an easy gate to close or open even for an adult i m glad that i only have to open it occasionally or it would be such a hassle that i would return it it s an extremely sturdy gate though and my 50 pound dog hasn t been able to get past it yet 
5 5 my daughter in law loves it for his son 
4 4 i bought 2 one for my 7 year old daughter and 1 for my 3 year old son they chose the same color and they love the design they are easy to hold and keep the water cool for an extended period of time in the hot sun however i noticed that one of the bottle does not quite close as tightly as the other and it is difficult to close it even for my 7 year old sometimes it is leaky so i give it a 4 star i hate the process of returning and exchanging so we will keep using it since it is not a serious defect otherwise it is a great product 
1 4 my baby slept really well with this sound machine with two big dogs that bark whenever anyone comes to the door it s essential to block out sudden loud noises we travel a lot and bring it with us on overnight trips so it gets tossed around quite a bit after about 5 months the volume knob would no longer click to the 34 off 34 position but it was still functional after 7 months it stopped working completely and i threw it away forgetting about the 1 year warranty looking at other sound machines available i m tempted to just buy this one again even though it eventually broke pros compactno automatic shutoff sometimes it takes longer than 20 minutes to fall asleep option to plug in or use batteriesinexpensivevolume controlcons not too durable
5 5 she likes it very much
5 5 fits perfect in my 2012 malibu the kids will never stop kicking but at least now i don t have to clean mud off all of the time nice durable fabric and they are easy to attach to head rest 
5 5 great product as expected
5 4 overall i m very happy with this purchase the diapers are great and i was pleasantly surprisdd when i recieved them sooner than anticipated if i had one suggestion it would be for a more customizable selection of designs 
5 3 good quality but i was missing a knife in one of my sets 
5 5 best deal out there 
5 5 so fun to give to baby for tummy time 
1 1 bought this same unit last year but this year s model doesn t fit too tall need to crush it down to be able to fit the cover properly and make it fit too much bother to return hopefully it will still work in this crushed state 
5 5 this is beautiful and different than most just adorable 
1 1 both tires blew after only using them a few times 
5 5 we throw two in her crib when we put her to bed and she smiles and waves every time she sees that little pink bear 
5 5 thanks
4 5 the only thing missing is a tracking chip 
5 4 cute love it
5 5 my babies have all loved these 
5 5 best baby product ever the weight of the animal keeps the pacifier closer to my baby s mouth during sleep she loves clutching the animal and holding it herself a good item to help with basic motor skills 
5 5 ordered for a friend who just had a new baby my daughter loved hers when she was first born plus it helps keeps the pacifier in and or close by 
1 1 pacifier would not stay attached to stuffed animal
1 1 they have a hole in the nipple that results in baby swallowing a ton of air not sure why it was designed that way but i am definitely not using this product i would not recommend it 
5 5 i m happy 
5 5 i bought this as a gift and i couldn t be happier it is very well made and too cute my daughter was tickled to get this for her new foster baby and the baby loves it it also came very fast i will definitely buy more of this product 
5 3 this product was adorable but the beak on the duck is much lower than the other wubba nubs so it fell out of my babies mouth instead of staying in place like others love this product but duck is not great for my one month old maybe later when she can hold it 
5 5 so adorable and exactly as described 
5 5 perfecto
5 5 bought for my sister an she absolutely adores it says all of it will fit her needs perfectly excellent present an if i lived closer to her i am sure i would love it as well 
5 5 all rigth
1 1 the money is not returned
5 5 so cute and durable my baby loves these 
5 1 my babies did not like these 
5 1 my babies didn t like these 
5 5 our favorite wubbanub animal this one is great for our baby who sleeps with her head turned to the side we can prop the tiger up so that the paci doesn t slip out as easily it lays flat on her chest well too it also has a nice weight to it 
3 4 i live the idea of it but realistically speaking if your baby is screaming because he s not feeling well it ll be a little hard to keep him sucking this to try to get his temp 
5 5 nice
5 5 we purchased this for two reasons one being that it makes trying to find the pacifier in the dark or in the car way easier and two so that our daughter would be able to find it and hold on to it product is well made and well packaged item is machine washable we found this out after it took a swim in the porcelain throne and very durable highly recommended for anyone with little ones who are still using a pacifier 
4 4 fits all pacifiers well we have several love that it doesn t just flop open but the downside is that sometimes that means it takes some muscle and wiggle to open it not so good when the baby is having a meltdown in a public place 
5 5 baby loves this easy to clean and carry we have 2
5 5 the local hospitals use these in the nursery but their are vanilla scented hold on to those pacifiers the unscented take a little longer for our little ones to find comfort using i like that the soothie portion is the same as on the avent feeding system i think it s comforting for baby to have same feel and shape when being fed for the first few months these pacifiers last for a long time i would recommend them to new moms 
5 5 recommended by the hospital high quality pacifiers even the pediatrician recommended this brand buy with confidence i highly recommend this product 
5 5 i actually bought at a retailer but my 5 week old loves it already 
5 5 good 
5 5 soothies are the only kind of pacifier that my daughter will take wubbanubs are not only cute but the animal provided actually gave her something to hold onto when she got big enough and when i would lay it on her chest she could sleep without the pacifier falling out and rolling away love these 
5 5 great product 
1 1 very bad experience for this shopping when i using the fan to dry up the bottles it s working on first second then somke is coming out if i m not living in oversea i will ask for refund i just very very unhappy with this product 
5 5 my son was very particular about what type of pacifiers he would use if it wasn t a mustache he wasn t interested in using it i ended up buying at least 6 different mustachifiers because he loved them so much the expressions on peoples faces when they saw him were priceless there were many times people would look at him and burst out laughing it was great very cute 
5 5 very good baby girl very soft 
5 5 the glow feature is the best part of these 
5 5 best pacifier ever my son will only use these 
5 5 cute
3 5 ok
5 5 great quality and too cute 
5 3 i wish i could give this product a better review because it honestly is a great pacifier for small infants these soothies have saved my sanity many nights and are excellent in that i dont have to worry about water collecting in the pacifier but the older and chunkier my infant is getting the more her little thick fingers are get stuck in the center of the pacifier when learning to pull her pacifier to her mouth and play with it she almost always gets her thumb stuck in the pacifier center i am a hawk over my baby so her finger never stays in there for long but the suction created makes it difficult to remove the pacifier from her finger at times after struggling with this issue for 3 days i finally got her a competitors pacifier that is very similar in design to reduce my anxierty and her risk of injury associated with her finger being lodged in the pacifier s nipple center 
3 3 i put baby wipes in this bag and put it in a tight cross over bag because i was going on a trip it is a really cute bag but leaked i was really hoping it would not leak because it is adorable the bag was stuffed tight not sure if that is why it leaked but if it is a wet bag i would hope that it would not leak in any bag that i would put it in i will keep it and use it for somethingelse not sure what at this point disappointed that it leaked how it leaked was it was wet on the corner of one of the sides i went to pull it out and it was damp and you could see where it was wet cute design and maybe needs some fine tuning 
5 5 baby holds onto animal as using the pacifier great size nipple 
5 3 great product adorable pattern and great functionality :)
5 4 beautiful
5 5 great seller and product
5 5 the pricing is so awesome this pacifier sells for more than twice as much in stores 
5 2 i bought it for a boy s babyshower and gor two pink pacifiers 
5 5 good quality cute and soft 
5 5 vhhggdyybbyybbggdddbdyybbyysjyybb
5 5 these are the best bottles i have ever used 
5 5 our wubbanub is so popular with my daughter that we are actually now starting to limit how often we let her use it to naptime she was never much of a pacifier user until we introduced the wubbanub this is great for helping her nap great for long car rides and if we didn t limit her she would have it in her mouth all day long the stuffed cow part is durable and easy to clean overall a great pacifier option 
5 3 doesn t light up much in the night but my daughter loves it
5 4 excellent pacifiers when my son rejected his newborn green pacifiers after 6 months we went straight to these and havent looked back after awhile they crack and moisture gets inside and i throw them away but for now they are great 
5 5 best pacifier we have ever used for our kids excellent ventilation around the mouth 
5 5 our hospital gave us the philips avent pacifier which is the only pacifier our child will take however she had an issue with keeping it in her mouth so we bought the wubbanub this attaches to the binky and acts as a counter weight when your baby decides to take a break from sucking the benefit is that it doesn t fall out of your childs mouth and doesn t require constant repositioning the other bonus is that it gives the momma a break from breastfeeding coming from a new father and mother this is a product definitely worth the investment 
5 5 these are the perfect size for a newborn and well worth the investment since we ve always needed pacifiers most in the beginning i love the size and shape of these and so does my baby i also like that the pacifier is transparent so you can see more of the baby s face and that they blend in and aren t so attention grabbing the nipple covers are also a really nice touch i m not typically worried about germs but i also don t want junk to get all over my baby s pacifier highly recommended 
5 5 it s nice
5 5 the kid loves it 
5 5 baby loves these i love that they are pure silicone and they have as ring for attaching a pacifier clip 
5 5 excellent
5 5 these are the best stays in their mouth and easier to find 
5 5 sjehdg
5 5 shzhshs
5 5 these are precious well made and my granddaughter loved it 
5 4 i really liked the idea of this pacifier especially no plastic for in the crib and after reading reviews on how big the nipple was i ordered the smaller size so i waisted my money the nipple is super small and my daughter can t keep it in her mouth i m going to try the bigger size and hopefully that works out

5 5 glow in the dark pacifiers are a lifeline to parents who need sleep we don t just put one or two in the crib we put four five or six when our precious child wakes in the night and gives a cry we can see on the child monitor that our baby reaches out to find a pacifier and once in the mouth our baby goes back to sleep wonderful before we were sleep deprived when awakened during the night over and over and over now having to get up in the night is an unusual night versus an every night trip thanks
5 5 exactly what i needed to help me get in and out of the bath and to help me hold on thank you for making a secure product at an affordable price 
5 4 love them
5 5 i bought it as a gift 
3 3 i bought the regalo easy step extra tall walk thru gate for our two toddler grandchildren visiting from the uk during the holidays the 2 1 2 year old was smart and tall enough to open the gate himself the gate is not real sturdy as the attachments to the threshold didn t stay well with the tots pushing on it we didn t want to permanently anchor it since they were only here for 2 months but with their next visit we will the walk through space is a bit tight for a larger hipped person basically the gate served its purpose wish i could have given it a better rating but sometimes you get what you pay for 
5 5 fair price for excellent rattle toy baby loves it 
5 5 works great to keep my daughter s car seat clean when we travel has a convenient handle and easily folds into a small pouch when not in use
5 1 in the picture has 8 colors and i thought i was getting the 8 headbands but really dissapointed because i only got one i shoulded read better and it says one pc 
5 5 i love these packets they are so easy to use and i love that i can throw them in the dishwasher and the freezer they make baby food pure storing a breeze i want to buy more 
5 5 very nice canopy and fits my chicco keyfit 30 infant car seat well love that the baby can see through the net and you can check on the baby while being protected from sunlight wind and bugs exactly what i was looking for plus its very pretty in pink color 
5 4 we just purchased this for our little boy and it seems to be working well it fits good other than he wants to try and untie it hopefully it lasts long enough to he can get where he can sit up and don t fall over 
4 5 works perfect wish it was a little longer though
5 5 it came in very fast and clean 
5 5 i used this bassinet for both my children they slept peacefully not to expensive very easy to put together 
5 5 this was so easy to install the tension rods just snug up to the door frame or wall and stay firmly in place even when we bump in to it keeps my dogs out of the kitchen wonderfully i am ordering another for my bedroom door as well until my new little one stops the need to pee on my bed 
5 5 good gift for mothers day :)
4 3 my son loves these cups because his favorite character is iron man however one of the lids completely cracked in half after only a month of use hope the other one holds up 
5 5 this is a great mirror i purchased it for my husband s car nissan xterra which doesn t have a middle headrest it was easy to install on the side headrest 1 min and angled in 30 seconds for a perfect view of baby from the driver s side now i have mirror envy the mirror is much clearer and higher quality than a standard baby mirror not only can we see our precious cargo with stunning clarity he really seems to enjoy admiring himself and anything that keeps baby happy during long car rides is a bonus i don t have anything bad to say other than beware of mirror envy i may be buying a second one soon 
3 2 it s only 3 but buy the munchkin one they last longer 
3 3 well first it didn t stick to the window i don t know if it was me or the product or what i have a maxima so i was able to wedge it in between the top of the window and bottom of the window so its there i don t think i would buy again i made due because im cheap and this was cheap 
5 5 perfect for baby s room 
5 5 gave this as a gift and they loved it thus far 
5 3 i don t have another hand pump to compare this to but it s not particularly productive for me personally i have heard great things so i bought it but i think maybe hand pumps just aren t effective for me certainly if you re used to using an electric pump especially a double electric it s not going to be the same pumping varies from person to person this just doesn t work great for me i sort of got the idea from other reviews that it was similar to electrics or worked well for everyone 
5 3 sadly without messing with things and adding additional strings you can only use the pacifier that comes with it my little guy did not like that one so he has a new stuffed puppy instead 
5 5 awesome comparing to the medela symphony just as strong maybe even stronger love
5 5 great mirror nice a d big can see baby much clearer now 
5 5 very pleased
5 4 this is a great easy to clean sippy cup made from safe materials i like that it is dishwasher safe it does need a sleeve though my two year old son dropped it on his toe when it was full and now the toenail is black and blue and he ll probably lose it i think this can be easily solved by putting a softer sleeve on the bottle the silicone sleeves that pura kiki makes are pretty expensive and i saw some reviews stating that they leave a gap at the bottom where food particles and moisture can get stuck which is at least gross and at worst can make the bottle rust apparently they are not made to be taken on and off on a daily basis we purchased michelob ultra koozies taller slimmer beer can they fit great and are less than half the price of the silicone sleeves they also come on and off with each use which i feel is more sanitary you can find ones on amazon that do not have beer logos or references on them 
1 1 this gate is not meant for the top of the stairs it takes 2 hands to open it even says this in the user manual not very functional when you don t have both hands free to open it carrying your kid or anything else 
5 5 love our ubbi s purchased 2 one for our cloth diapers and one for regular disposable keeps smell contained and we love the modern look our gasket popped out and we couldn t get it back in after a year of use one email to customer service and a new ubbi was sent to our house with no questions asked incredibly happy customers thank you ubbi 
5 4 it s really cute and functional i love it 
5 5 this little bear was just the right size for a 2 year old and it is just the softest most cuddly little bear ever gund makes amazing stuffed animals i remembered from when my kids were little the best stuffed toys were gund this was a birthday present for my granddaughter she just loves it 
5 3 construction design for strength needs improving along with gate closure a 1 1 2 year old child was able to flex it back and forth not sure if it would have held if we had let him continue 
5 1 i don t know what all the hype is about it s an overpriced metal baby bottle you obviously can t microwave it because it s metal and it s hard to tell how much fluid you ve put inside because it s not translucent you have to look at these little notches inside 
4 1 it was cute as pictured but we bought it so that my grandson would not poke his legs through the bars but it flattened easily and out his legs came out we have tightened it and the same thing happens 
5 5 we only use these for my kids 
5 5 ninja turtles band aid
5 5 my daughter love her new room now
5 5 djsyshashssh
5 5 fjdhdhfglhdg
5 5 xgdgdgfch
5 5 my daughter loves this 
5 5 rgsjdntztj
5 5 my children like it 
4 4 not as resistant to holes from biting on it as other brands but my son will only use this style of bulb
5 5 i love this paci i always wondered why wubbanubs existed and what the point of the animal was until my baby girl came along she doesn t keep the paci in her mouth that well on her own so we tuck the kitten animal under her arms to keep it secured these are genius 
5 5 second time buying the cow my dog ate the first one he gets a little dingy because of the white but we just toss it in the wash machine and it comes out like new 
5 5 this is very good i like it
5 5 we love our wubbanub 
5 5 my daughter loves this 
5 5 this was the pacifier used at the hospital so the twins have been used to them since birth i like that it does not squish their nose soft flexible material easy to clean good price point i probably have 10 at this point because i go through several a day with twins and this way i don t keep playing 34 find the pacifier 34 make sure you note the sizes on the package because with each size the harder the rubber is and my babies definitely noticed the difference to the point where they don t like the green ones 3 6 m even though they are 4 months old 
4 4 this pacifiers are little harder than the newborn pacifiers my boys did not take to them at first but i guess they are made of harder rubber because of the possibility of teething just know that these are a little more harder than the newborn or 0 3 months size we have used them for a month now and they are still just as hard as they came out of the package even though we have sterilize them every single night otherwise good brand 
2 3 these are very thin i m not sure i would actually believe they would keep something really wet secured 
5 2 nipple was very small and rubber was very soft i expected a more heavy duty pacifier 
5 3 my baby is 5 months old and thought i should upgrade to the 3month pacifier but he will not take these i think the only difference is that they are hardermore firm anyways i put them away and will try at a later date :)
5 5 bought lots of these as my dog keeps stealing them and chewing them up baby likes them a lot as well 
5 5 this is very good i like it
5 5 both of our kids love these pacis they hold up well and clean nicely 
5 5 awesome just what i was looking for and fast shipping 
5 5 perfect compliment to the avent bottles 
5 5 my 7 week old loves these more than any other brand not bulky and light he can actually hang on to these as opposed to the all rubber silicone ones 
5 5 good
5 5 can t live without these all of my kids were born 34 tongue tied 34 and conventional stubby plugs never worked they refused to use them these are the only pacifiers my 3 kids would take i think the length of the nipple is easier for a baby who has difficulty latching where the conventional plugs are too short a true in the store at midnight cuz you lost the last one kind of saving buy 
5 2 too large and cumbersome for my baby
5 5 only paci my little one will use 
5 5 i like it
5 5 starting using this kind of pacifier with my son 4 years ago and we decided to use them for our second since we never had complaints designs on them are wonderful and very durable my kids teeth are perfect
4 2 pacifiers are ok but picture shows 4 units and they only deliver two misleading advertising 
5 4 these work well for my newborn preemie although she doesn t take them as well as the ones they gave her in the hospital these are small enough that they work for her tiny mouth without gagging or choking her and the design is nice as well these work well with a pacifier clip thanks to the ring that allows you to attach it 
5 5 the best pacifiers for those middle of the night wake ups they glow in the dark so they are easy to find 
5 5 baby likes this wubba and its a good shape for him to grasp and hold onto it washes easily and came packaged as expected 
5 5 really bright glow in the dark i really wish my toddler didn t reject them i recommend starting these out on a younger baby not a 15 month old he was too attached to the soothie for my next baby i will def be switch to these right away they are really good quality it would really benefit any co sleepers 
4 4 we were very impressed with this unit however after just two and a half months it stopped working properly despite keeping it clean and using distilled water thankfully we could send it back for a free replacement since it was within 90 days of purchase and we did now we have the same unit and hope it will work for at least 6 months we do use it daily because it breaks so quickly i will give it only 4 stars if it were more reliable it would be worth 5 stars 
5 5 these are very nice pacifiers binkies or a 34 hush hushies 34 as we call them we received the clear set which is perfect because they are gender neutral i wasn t entirely sure which color would arrive but these are the ones i wanted the shape is ideal because as a bf mom it s important that it be very similar in shape and size for an easy transition back and forth our babies were always very picky about the shape each one taking to different kinds the first child only took the nipples that were flat on one side while the second preferred the ones which are not but rather like these round all the way around they are also long enough that they can stay in easy but still bulbous these are thinner at the base than they are at the tip unlike the hospital issued ones which are the same size all the way from base to bulb those tend to pop straight out of the babies mouth where these stay in and are a more natural fit for them they are the litle handles to attach to a ribbon holder so they stay within reach and being clear they will never chip or peel like some of the plastic ones the silicone material is easy to clean and disinfect and i would definitely recommend these as a gift or necessity buy for another little one i purchased this set at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions expressed are my own 
4 4 i really like the pacifiers and surprisingly my son did too i hadn t been able to find one that he like and he seemed to like this one they came in a pack of two in a nice plastic container the quality of the pacifiers is really nice the only thing that i did not like was that i received pink ones it would have been nice to be given the option to choose the color now my son has a pink pacifier i will be giving the other away since i have no use for it overall i loved this pacifier just not the color i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review 
5 1 none available 
5 5 our little guy is not a fan of any old pacifier but he sure likes these i like the natural product for him and the texture is great when they start to gum and teeth too ordered their teether for that reason 
5 5 can not go wrong with this brand it is made with high quality and makes a great product will buy more for the next age group 
4 4 i hoped this would of been bigger 
5 5 my daughter s best friend :)
5 5 great for baby shower 
5 5 i got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review this orthodontic pacifier is tasteless and odor free silicone nipple that makes an easy transition between pacifier breast and bottle i myself is a breastfeeding mom and i can say that this can make an easy transition from my breast to this pacifier although we had several times to try to make him used to it but after several tries he already get used to it my baby is now very comfortable in using them it is also easy to clean and sterilize it afterwards i would definitely recommend this pacifiers to my friends and relatives 
5 4 this was a gift for a new mother she said it works great 
5 5 love it
5 5 good product only pacifier my infant will take 
4 2 design is poor as one removes the lid the accessories often fall off and that means they have to be sterilized again especially if you are trying to sterilize more than just bottles the design doesn t work i use dr browns bottles and it was a mess the overall function is fine though 
5 2 my daughter did not like the shape of this paci at all i also tried to clean it a couple times but the plush toy wold get soaked most babies cant put their mouth around something so circular too round 
5 5 love these little binkies best brand out there 
5 5 thank you
5 5 great product great seller 
2 2 the hook is poorly designed in that there is no closure to attach the case to something you simply bend the hook so that the gap is large enough to pass through whatever anchor point you are hooking the case to this results in the case falling off if you accidentally grab it and pull even the slightest bit or if you brush it against something i would not buy this again 
5 5 saw this on shark tank and ordered before episode was over haven t actually used it bc my baby is still a newborn but can t wait 
1 1 very disappointed with this purchase the pacifier is sewn onto the animal so it s very hard to clean 
5 5 my baby is strictly breast fed and would not take any pacifier we tried every type out there but she loves this one
3 1 the butterfly version is much better these are uncomfortable for my baby as they hit his nose he won t use them order the butterfly version instead 
5 5 cute
5 5 cute
5 5 my baby loved these particular pacifiers compared to others the plastic on the rim part is very hard the sucking portion is medium soft silicone and the pacifiers have a ring on them so you can easily move them around strap them to something 
5 5 i got one of these pacifiers in the 0 months size free with the chicco keyfit 30 carseat of course it is the only pacifier my baby likes 
5 5 so cute and fun 
5 5 good
5 5 when i had my baby we used the pacifier provided by the hospital avent soothie i noticed that the pacifier would go flying out of his mouth quite frequently i did a lot of research on pacifiers and found out that the avent soothie is terrible for a babies developing mouth and can lead to many dental and orthodontic issues down the road after my research i decided to go with these and they are amazing they are designed to fit your babies mouth properly i will never get another kind of pacifier it never flies across the room when he is trying to suckle on it hwill sleep all night with this in his mouth and have no issues you should definitely get this over any other pacifier on the market 
5 5 great product 
5 5 i can t say this pacifier will work for every baby but it worked perfectly for our 8 week old we tried the very popular green soothie starting week 3 and she just didn t like it she d push out of her mouth and if she did accept it it usually fell out immediately this pacifier is softer and flatter which resembles a nipple more the cover is also a bit curved helping it stay in her mouth a bit longer she really likes it and it s made nap time much easier i highly recommend it 
5 5 so cute and fun 
5 5 great
5 5 still use this type she s 1 yr old buy lots of them since we tend to misplace them need a back up at grandmas house 
5 4 baby likes it 
5 5 tomme tippee makes great products i son has always taking to there bottles and also the pacifiers these come in a 2 pack and they come in a nice plastic container that can also be used for storage in diaper bag these are made with a hard plastic so they will last and hold up well we love tomme tippee products 
5 5 i love tomme tippee i trust this product so much my daughter s love the pacifier because it s so soft and harmless for the baby specially for the new born baby 
5 5 fast shipping expected what showed up to my door second purchase of these for my girls needed a back up 
5 5 wish i had one when my sons were born it works great not only keeping the paci clean it can hook on anything to keep it handy
5 5 perfect it s washable and convenient love that it s chemical free 
5 5 these pacifiers are great my son loves them and it s easy for him to put in and take out of his mouth great product 
5 4 these are nice and affordable 
5 5 my little girl love these she can get a hold of them good and chew on them 
5 5 cute baby item went well with other items purchased
5 5 my boy will only suck a mam we would be lost without them 
5 5 love love love love there aren t enough words to express how much my 18 month old loves her puppies as she calls them we e had to be about 6 since she s constantly hiding them or throwing them in the trash not because she doesn t like them just because she s only just discovered the trash it s just a marvelous invention and my daughter goes to sleep immediately as long as she ha a couple of puppies in her crib we are great believers in pacifiers as is since 2010 the american association of pediatricians i know they re not for everyone but taking our five year old s away when she was 2 was no problem at all and some studies have shown they help prevent sids whatever you think about the pacifier itself this is just a genius invention which gives my little girl all the comfort she needs to go to sleep soundly thank god 
5 4 sooo cute
5 5 my baby prefers this style pacifier would recommend 
5 5 i love the smaller size on this pacifier it s perfect for little ones i ve always thought that regular pacifiers were just huge this solves that problem i gave it to my two month old who had been using soothies previously it s a perfect fit for him and does not make his whole face disappear obnoxiously honestly i am not planning on upgrading to something larger for a while this is perfect for him even 3 weeks later at almost 3 months old it s a nice soft nipple and a very discreet gentle color perfect all around 
5 5 my baby can t fall asleep without these soothies must have for your little one 
5 5 love it we can easily strap this in with the baby in her carseat and it keeps her pacified 
5 5 seems like there s a wipe for everything these days 
5 5 the real best pacifier we tried others and this is the winner for the baby
5 5 i luved it thankz a lot 
5 5 well loved by baby
5 5 always ben a fan of tomme tippee seens my girl 4 yrs ago now am goin to have a baby boy so i decided to keep with tomme tippee brand i love the new products and changes they made to some products these are different shape then what i buy to my girl really cute cant wait to see my baby with them i love them how cute they are greeat quality as always and much softer then others brands
5 5 this was a gift they loved it 
5 5 this is the only pacifier our newborn will take it s a lifesaver ordered more the second we saw she liked them i do wish that you were able to choose the design as we got the boy s however they all work the same and we purchased for function the blue are still cute 
5 5 they work great for my younger one and the fact they glow in the dark is awesome because i don t need to search for it anymore when they fall out his mouth i haven t noticed in the last month that the glow itself bothers him or distracts him so thats great too 
5 5 love them
5 5 i was pleased with them i bought them as a gift for my brother and sister in law and they loved them too 
5 5 my son loves these he also likes the newborn size better than the 0 6 i recommend parents try both sizes 
5 5 great item thanks a lot 
5 5 great item thanks a lot 
1 1 recall so returned
5 5 this is the only kind of binky my daughter will take so happy to be able to find them here 
2 2 not very happy baby doesn t seem to like them in fact it helped to wean him off the pacifier 
5 5 losing a pacifier at night is a thing of the past my daughter goes to sleep with a binky and then spits it out every time she wakes up and fusses she just wants it back to go back to sleep these are so easy to find and hold their 34 glow charge 34 for a long time it is still glowing after 7 hours after just sitting out during the day 
5 5 dfdrfthdhdjx
5 5 we have had several of these they are wonderful we do not leave the house without them 
5 3 none available 
5 2 baby has trouble 34 latching 34 onto these pacis :(
5 5 these are the best pacifiers with my second daughter we tried the green ones you get from the hospital but she couldn t keep them in her mouth so we went to the orthodontic style of nuk but those things are gross because after a month or so they smell funky no matter how much you wash and sanitize them i love the one piece style of this and that it s silicone like the hospital style and that it has the orthodontic tip perfect 
5 5 love these cute novelty pacifiers unique styles and made well 5 stars for this seller even though it took longer to get than i thought i definetly will get more as needed 
5 3 i want to love this steamer really i do when it works it s awesome we got it to sterilize bottles in the hospital while our daughter had open heart surgery heres the issue you have to be beyond precise with how much water you pour in or the steamer doesn t work this precision is marred by the fact that the bottles you put in are wet so they drip water and change your water levels it can make an overtired parent crazy plus if you put too much water in during the steam function all of the water spills out on your counter and if you aren t watching the steam cycle for the full 10 minutes the water can spill off of your counter and ruin your hardwood floor so from experience i recommend putting a jelly pan underneath the steamer 
5 5 it s was a heaven sent help my baby to sleep big help for traveling by plane too my baby loves it 
5 5 i like it
5 5 i purchased this for a co worker who has a son due to be born this summer an inexpensive gift idea that s bpa free and officially licensed by ncaa 
5 4 nice quality things i haven t used them this is a gift so i can t speak of the actual usefulness 
5 5 these are amazing and my babies favorite i had some similar that had no loop to hook to her but these are so easy to find a paci attachment for and so soft for her to suck on 
5 5 my little man loves these things i honestly didn t realize they were 34 vanilla 34 and it was an added perk 
5 5 our baby finally seems to love these
5 1 these left a bright red sunburn looking mark everywhere they touched my son s face the unflavored avent soothies do not i love the avent products these however are not really worth trying stick with the normal ones 
5 5 exactly as described fast delivery
5 5 i love these pacifiers because of the natural rubber and my son prefers these over the plastic ones too they re super easy to clean 
5 5 adorable
5 1 these pacifiers would have been perfect if they had a curve to their shields they re flat and don t hug the face so they don t stay in the mouth very long which is a shame because they look absolutely adorable 
5 4 my daughter will only use mam pacifiers i prefer buying them on amazon because of the variety of designs available 
5 5 only down side is my daughter is 2 and won t give up girafeeeee 
5 5 good item she loves them
3 3 sounds good in theory but my little one did not like it so i stored it away after a few months it became disgustingly sticky for some reason i did wash it before putting it away i m glad my kid didn t like it or the sticky stuff might have ended up in the mouth or ingested 
1 1 our baby does not accept it
5 5 i had stocked up on soothies in expectation of my newborn if you ve had a baby in a hospital you re probably familiar with the big green ones my son didn t reject them outright but he didn t seem to be a fan i tried one of these within days of coming home from the hospital he instantly took it and it s clearly his favorite we haven t had any problems with nipple confusion while breastfeeding supply is another issue but largely resolved aesthetically i prefer being able to see more of his face and not just his pacifier but really the important things are that it hasn t interfered with nursing and he loves it if you re interested in a pacifier for your newborn i highly recommend trying this one 
5 5 smells so good my 6 month old loves it 
5 5 great thanks
5 5 this is the only pacifier my child will use 
5 4 she seems to pull this one out more than her other ones i think because of how long it is i m not really sure great product she s just used to her pinky bear 
5 5 easy to clean 1 piece of silicone means easier to sanitize too 
5 5 the only thing my daughter will use 
5 5 i honestly thought these were a joke and couldn t believe parents paid money for these i m hooked these saved my sanity and precious time i hardly have to binky hunt now my son loves them they are easily washed no complaints 
5 5 my daughter is 10 months old and she never really liked pacifiers a friend came over with her son born a week after my daughter he was wearing a pacifier of course my daughter got curious and grabbed his pacifier and put it in her mouth and loved it ever since i thought these were age appropriate since she knows how to suck a straw love them 
5 3 adorable this was a gift my son had the dino version unfortunately he never took a paci 
5 5 nice one for my one year old i would certainly recommend this product 
5 5 haven t had water get inside of them like most and they don t fall out of my sons mouth no cons as of yet
5 5 got one of these as a freebie when i was pregnant unfortunately it was clear and got lost easily these stand out awesomely no matter where it falls and my son loves them 
5 5 never disappointed i remembered having a pacifier pod 8 years ago that i loved so i knew just what to order with this baby best quality out there 
5 5 love that they glow in the dark so convenient and it really works 
5 5 my grandson loves these
5 5 best pacifiers ever they re cute safe well constructed gives jr something to hold onto even a baby and you ll never lose it when he she inevitably flings it 20 yards away we have the monkey the duck the triceratops and the longhorn bull only needed one but they re so darn cute 
5 4 nice
5 5 baby loves it so i do too :)
5 5 love this pacifier when i wahed it for the first time the fabric on the belly and feet faded to white :(
2 3 it does not look like how i thought
5 5 i bought this wubbanub for my great grandson and he loves it this puppy is small enough for even the smallest of infants he loves it because it gives him something to hold on to and the nipple is small enough and soft enough for him to use glad that i bought it for him 
5 5 my favorite pacifier on the market it s curved away from baby s face which means less rash and fewer marks it s all one piece so it s easy to clean and you don t have to worry about moisture getting trapped and frankly it looks hilarious since it s see through these are all i use 
3 4 wish it came with sticky backs
5 5 so cute i just love it
5 3 good
5 5 this is the best baby bottle sterilizer it sterilizes 6 bottles at a time it is not too big and bulky and best part of all it dries the bottles i have used other sterilizers that only sterilize and doesnt dry this is a lifechanger also it is pretty quiet and doesnt make too much noise absolutley love it 
5 1 why does is say stretch nothing about is stretches we picked this one instead of any of the others because we thought it would stretch and be fun for or daughter but nope no stretching 
3 3 absolutely love them although i m a little disappointed i didn t receive the pink colors like i order 
5 5 i don t know how my baby lived without this she is 9 months old now and has been using it daily since she was 3 months she prefers it to any other pacifier and doesn t seem to mind that she s still using the 34 small 34 size such a smart design once they start grasping toys they can easily get this pacifier back into their mouth on their own without help 
5 5 love these i have been trying to find pacifiers that don t hold the soap bubbles and water after washing these do a little bit but not as bad as the nuks the nuks and these are the only ones we can get our son to take right now 
5 5 this is such a cute pacifier used to have a duck but lost it so i ordered this and my little man loves it to he loves holding onto the elephant leg 
5 5 the best in quality and my lil one only prefers these 
1 1 i didn t like the way this fit the crib was saggy and would not tighten despite several attempts returned 
5 4 functional item 
5 5 i bought this on sale at ross for a ridiculously low price of 10 because the outer box was dented my closet is done in a slightly darker green so this matched really well and gave me a surprising amount of extra space the small hangers are good for my small tank tops with spaghetti straps and some of my decorated bras and bikinis but they are too small for most other grownup clothing this is meant for a baby closet and i am an adult with no kids however i am also a size 2 and petite so a lot of my clothing is really small i also have a ton of tank tops skinny jeans and tiny shirts this worked really well for me especially when i added some taller bins for the bottom with jeans and shorts and i put the matching ones from this set on the upper level with some light scarves belts and other accessories the dividers and labels also came in handy for organizing the various colors and types of clothing my closet is huge and i bought a green striped ikea organizing set years ago and this was the only other thing i ever found to remotely match it once i put it in my closet you can t tell it is for a baby because i use it on the side with smaller clothing items it added some much needed space and looks a lot more organized and neat i normally would never think to look in the baby section for organizing solutions but in this case i am glad i was passing through the kid s aisle and noticed this color would match the stuff i already had it seems sturdy enough for my petite clothing and probably works well for lighter weight baby and kids clothing this is maybe not the thing to buy if you wear plus sized clothing but for babies kids small teens and someone my size it is sturdy and large enough to add a good amount of extra storage this was for sure my cheapest closet makeover ever i think this set was around 10 and the extra bins were 5 15 bucks is not bad considering i spent around 100 on the ikea organizing set my size 2 and 3 shorts and jeans fit perfectly on the shelves or in bins when folded but any larger and you probably need a teen or adult size organizer i would totally recommend this to parents but not for most adults unless your clothing is tiny like mine is if you are petite then it s a great bargain 
5 5 love this its a great product and fits perfect
2 1 1 the bumper bare 34 broken 34 2 brake wire 34 cut off 34 
5 5 works excellent 
5 2 this was a gift so i didn t buy it the mattress is an inch and and half too narrow for our play yard the result is a gap between the mattress and side that catches toys and occasionally our child s leg or arm extra firm is accurate our child doesn t sleep well on this mattress at all it is a great improvement over the pad that came with our yard especially for everyday playing and safety it has its place just not as a travel mattress 
5 5 great 
4 5 great little pacifier for a newborn it s constructed very well has plenty of airflow and the design does not cover the nose i really like that it comes with a cap to keep it clean when not being used and it can be sterilized overall i would recommend this if you need a pacifier for a newborn 0 2 month old 
4 4 ok i initially gave a 1 star review i did not like the pillowcase the seller sent me a new upgraded pillowcase free of charge he also informed me that they are planning to upgrade the pillowcase basically this pillow is filled with that loose cotton ball like foam when it starts to go flat as they all do eventually i will open a corner and replace the filling 
5 5 i love this necklace and so does my daughter i feel like i can throw it on with any outfit and it look adorable i get compliments every time i wear it the other day we went to visit a friends new baby i didn t want to bring a ton of stuff with me so i wore my mama little necklace and it entertained my daughter the whole time plus she s always pulling on people s necklaces already so she loves that this is one she s actually allowed to chew on i will definitely be ordering other stuff from this company in the future 
5 5 amazing for poopoo
5 4 great buy for day care 
1 1 the adhesives stuck for less than 24 hours unless you bolt these in they are useless 
1 3 the product is defective the red button does not work plus the sound is very low
4 3 very comfy for the early months although as i m getting bigger i wish this was too it s losing its fluff and i still have two months to go it s good for the price though 
5 5 happy baby now thanks great quality
5 5 this pad is perfect for our gender neutral nursery we have a baby girl but wanted things not too 34 girly 34 this print fits the bill nicely the material is soft and it washes beautifully stains come right out in normal washing there didn t seem to be any shrinkage and the band has retained it s stretchiness so that it fits the same over the pad every time 
5 2 shipping go fast it s perfectbear is beautiful but it s not the samethere is no drawing nor of writing
5 5 it is exactly as described working very well 
5 5 i love it my grand baby is eating his cereal out of it
5 5 this was delivered super fast and came in great condition there was a small nick on one of the drawers but i used a little white out and it covered it i love the look of these and they were pretty easy to put together 
5 5 this is a great baby monitor for the price we were looking to purchase a video monitor since our daughter began climbing out of her crib my sister in law recommended this model and we decided to give it a shot it is very easy to set up and use i can even bring this camera outside when i m in the yard and it keeps its signal definitely a keeper 
5 5 my child loved this 
5 4 very nice as described 
5 5 just what we were looking for 
1 3 great idea however if you have or want a spectra pump don t waste your money or breastmilk for that matter none of the adapters are actually made for the spectra they tell you to use the avent adapters which don t properly fit i just spilled and entire boob because of the fit 
1 3 lid flimsy when open child cannot lean back
4 2  they do not stick at least for us i guess they are good for storage bowls for on the go though 
5 5 looked all over for a pad to replace the one that came on my daughter s bed changing table combo price and shipping were very agreeable 
5 3 i got these for travel but found that a fair number of places houses usually didn t have compatible chairs they weren t tall enough or they had arms so instead we ended up getting two of kelsyus travel high chairs for our twins and i wish we d skipped straight to them instead they last from age 6 months until 6 years and work as high chairs camp chairs etc the twins can just use them for so much longer i wish i had known about them before buying the high chair pads http www amazon com gp product b007rf22xe ref oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00 ie utf8 psc 1
5 5 the first awesome thing about this toy is that it is machine washable air dry only i think it s silly when kid s toys are spot clean you re really not going to get a baby toy clean with spot cleaning especially when the toy is meant to be a teether the toy has a hanger and clacking beads as well as different textures including crinkle paper so far my son likes it especially since it makes clattering noises when he bangs it against the floor 
5 4 works great 
3 3 i like the look of this seat and the installation is cake it fit securely and quickly if looked like it would be comfortable the back was cushy and i thought my daughter would love it unfortunately the side impact head rest makes it impossible for the child to look out the side windows she was miserable not being able to see anything around her i m sending it back 
5 5 very easy application and removal without wall damage the colors are bright and vivid 
5 2 we have had this monitor for almost a year with one camera and it is great battery life of great picture and sound are both great only complaint has been that darn flashing light i cannot even tell you how bright it is we had to cover with electrical tape to be able to sleep however recently we bought a second camera because we re expecting a new baby being able to monitor multiple cameras was the primary selling point but peep mode apparently does not work with more than one camera paired in cascade mode this means the screen stays on constantly not only does that affect battery life but it affects my sleep too i only want the screen on when it needs to be we tried setting one camera as the primary to see if the other one would activate with noise and it doesn t what good is that if you re only using one camera then i recommend this monitor but i m very disappointed in the lack of flexibility with more than one camera 
5 5 this was my sons favorite teether and toy he loves the crinkle sound the 34 bunny ears 34 make
1 3 not a fan of the nipples 
5 5 good
5 1 none available 
5 5 good
4 4 it s good and our baby loves jumping in it but it makes a lot of noise this jumper is constructed with a compression spring housed in a plastic tube the compression spring is unstable and it bends and rubs against the sides of the plastic tube vibrating and making quite a bit of noise 4 stars because our baby seems to enjoy the noise and think it s part of the activity if you re looking for a quiet jumper look elsewhere 
5 5 good product
5 5 good
5 5 this works perfectly with my medela pump i love that the flange is one piece so there is less to wash i would recommend this product 
5 5 this stroller is worth the money no need to get a expensive stroller with different seats that attach to the same frame this is all in one converts to a pram and will lay flat it s easy to entertain my 7 month old in this stroller while we are at all day sport meets for my older son i recommended this to a friend and she loves it too great product 
5 5 wonderful for a 5 year old who is still light in weight 
5 1 these trimmer pads are of the same roughness and it is just too rough for babies 
5 5 this pillow is the perfect size for toddler heads my daughter loves it 
4 4 this is a great play yard it can be used inside or outside my biggest struggles have been with opening and closing it it is more difficult if you re not using both hands other than that the bulkiness is an issue merely because we have a small living room other than that i love the convertible 4 or 6 walls it is great for hanging toys and multicolored 
5 5 thank you very much and receive the products we are very pleased with the purchase 
5 5 cool
5 2 we really wanted to like this car seat because a couple friends of ours have it and love it we must have gotten a bad one because the tightening strap was impossibly hard to adjust i couldn t do it with one hand and could barely do it with two hands the buckle was also pretty difficult to unbuckle the head cushions were also too large for our guy he likes to look out the window and the cushion blocked his view we returned it 
5 3 it was larger than expected although it looked ok it is definitely plastic and has limited potential as a gift 
5 5 love this stuff for my cloth dipaers i use as preventative before i get an ammonia stink that some of my fellow cd mama s complain of i use this packet in clean diapers every three months and never have had an absorbance issue or ammonia stink 
5 3 this is perfect for traveling with a toddler my 4 year old loves it however after the first night of use the body of the sleeping bag ripped away from the pillow i imagine the first time i put it in the washing machine the sleeping bag will be a shambles i was expecting more quality and longevity from this product 
5 5 super useful it came in time and perfectly good 
5 5 bought this for a girlfriends baby shower and it is just so cute i have also purchased this before for my sister its a hit 
1 1 doesn t fit a graco stroller graco strollers have to be taken completely apart for these to even begin to work these are not easily used unless you cut them to fit them over bars for some reason even if you glue them to the handles they don t stick graco strollers need a different solution to the replacement situation this product isn t it i wish the product info would have said 34 not for graco strollers 34 in the description i wouldn t have wasted my time and money 
5 5 so nice
5 5 my baby loves this it s soft and snugly she takes naps in it daily and o can take it on road trips so she has a place to lounge wish they made it in adult size 
5 5 love it now my mom has a base for her car 
5 5 kids love them
5 4 the quality of the walker is incredibly good like another posted a car walker was sent out as is pictured but not as is described i m guessing there is no guaranteed way to get the dj walker as the documentation that comes with the walker lists both the car and the dj as options for this model my 9 month old loves it and the sounds can be turned low enough to where they don t annoy me when they re played for an hour straight by the little tyke if you don t care the theme of the walker this is as good as any of the other chicco walker options if you are wanting for sure a specific setup i would highly recommend you not risk this one 
5 5 these bags are awesome i keep them on the changing table and use them for soiled diapers i used to use the diaper genie but i hated leaving smelly diapers in the room until the container was filled this way i just throw the diapers away as they are used i also keep them in my diaper bag i ve used them numerous times for wet or dirty clothes 
4 3 i expected it to be a little bit bigger 
5 2 i was anxious to get the new upgraded version of the toddler seat when it arrived was disappointed to see that it feels much cheaper the g2 toddler seat feels more cushioned and comfy and i love the fact when u bought a color pack it came with seat and canopy changes so i could just swap it out and wash the other the g3 canopy pack comes with just the canopy the inside of the seat no longer has those handy little net pockets the snack cup is still bulky and aweful and the velcro in the back seems like it would not hold up long opposed to the zip feature of the g2 don t get me wrong i love the orbit just not impressed with the new seat upgrade 
4 2 the party trick of these baby carriers is that you can have two at a time my biggest complaint is that they are not really good baby carriers however it is legit that it can convert between two 34 normal 34 carriers and a unified twin carrier 
5 5 work better than the others no air in the tummy to cause a fussy baby
4 5 works great but i wish they were a little longer 
5 5 this was a much appreciated gift
5 5 this thing is nifty had that 34 new 34 smell i expect that to fade mini perforations for breathability do not know about waterproof ness yet great for a short rifle wrap or headscarf 
5 5  :)
5 5 works perfectly for our 15 month old and she will continue to fit without the insert as she grows straps attach it easily to a dining chair the storage of the tray under the chair is a great feature 
3 3 this changing pad works for changing diapers but isn t quite as big as i thought it would be and the quality is just okay 
5 5 i am incredibly content with this bag it is very spacious and perfect for an over packer like myself it definitely has some weight to it empty and even more being over packed but i don t mind it at all not like i carry it all the time it s perfect 
5 5 i was very please with this gift i bought it for a friends daughter when her baby was being christened he loved it so much that they actually brought it to the christening and he was grabbing it during the ceremony which of course meant a lot to me they said it seemed to make him settle down and not cry i liked it so much i bought another to keep on hand for the next christening of a friends child 
5 5 too cute 
5 5 great product
4 4 bed came on time fair price wood a bit cheap pain to put together alone the pieces i in the middle kept falling out of place until the entire bed was assembled and screws tightened pretty sturdy supports my son s weight just fine he s about 35 lbs i would recommend to a friend looking for a reasonably priced toddler bed 
5 5 very satisfied
5 5 love these bibs great coverage easy to put on take off lightweight and easy to clean and cute patterns what more can a mom ask for :)
5 3 with our first two kids we used the nap nanny when our third child was born we thought we would try this product instead in our opinion the nap nanny was a superior product in all but two respect which is that this one has a deeper recess for the child to lay in and is easier to clean other than that this is a downgrade the nap nanny was made of a foam rubber and was very soft and comfortable this product is a hard plastic frame covered by a thin padded outer shell if only they had used more padding i wouldn t have minded the change so much but this lacks any real padding on the bottom or sides and has just barely enough in the sleeping area we use these products in our bed we place it in between us and let our baby sleep in it until he is about 3 4 months old this makes the nightly feedings much easier 
2 1 it keeps coming off
5 5 good wet bag adorable design i got the foxy frolic print which has a white background and because this is a single layer bag it s rather see through i use this for my cloth diapers and while i haven t had a problem yet i could see messes smearing inside and being visible through the bag while it s not going to go through the material it d be kinda gross to see or if you have an easily embarrassed child their wet underwear could be seen through the lighter material i actually prefer the lite wet bag over the double layer wet bag by planet wise i bought the double layer style first 2 large and 1 medium the double layer bags tends to collect and hold water in the waterproof side during the wash cycle and it s an extra step to get the liner fully empty and reset into the cloth outer bag so it can fully dry plus i tend to wonder if the water that is trapped in the liner side is clean or not this bag being a single layer is much easier to flip inside out and back again 
5 4 cute idea and works well just wish the tether had been longer 
5 5 great organizer i have 3 kids and keeps everything organized neatly love it 
5 5 good
5 5 the little attached pouch is great it was easy to fold up and carry the bag through the airport until it was time to cover the stroller before boarding our flight it definitely kept our umbrella stroller in good condition traveling internationally 
2 2 was great for 3 months then split i expected to it to at least last a little longer very disappointed since it worked great 
5 4 for the price i think this is great my son is very happy with it britax seats are definitely more padded but they re also 3 times the price so i don t know if it s just to compare that i much prefer the armrests on thee graco highback turbobooster that we got for his sister though they arc down and make using the seatbelt with the armrests much easier i wish i would have gotten that model instead of this one but had i not had them side by side to compare then i would be quite happy with this seat 
5 5 they should be very proud of their product better than described wonderful thank you so much patty
5 2 some of the toys are ok one broke when i cleaned it so my daughter never got to use it and another broke into pieces 5 min after i handed it to her she is only 5 months so she didn t need a lot of power to brake it but what can you expect when you buy 6 toys for 6 
5 5 thanks for this
5 4 i took this on a two week vacation abroad where there was tons of walking and getting around via mass transit my goal was to purchase a very lightweight umbrella stroller that handled well and was reasonably priced pros this held up well when handled through baggage it s also pretty lightweight as i 5 2 34 115 was able to carry it with one hand while carrying my toddler and a diaper backpack it maneuvers well for a lightweight umbrella stroller and folds up compactly the shade is by far the best i ve seen amongst umbrella strollers the shade pulls all the way down to shield his face where he can t see what s in front of him this is helpful when he s napping cons the storage underneath is practically nonexistent you can probably store hand wipes or a light jacket but that s about it the lock is disappointing it s not permanently attached to the stroller and there have been a few instances where it flew off when unfolding the stroller i m going to try to see if i can secure the stroller together in the folded position by wrapping velcro around the metal bars where the original lock would be it also doesn t recline though my child still napped in the stroller just fine overall this was a great umbrella stroller to travel with and has taken a bit of abuse from bumpy sidewalks to being manhandled by baggage carriers i will probably turn to this for short errands 
5 4 slightly beaten
5 4 all in all an excellent product it runs large so be aware of that comfortable fabric and my toddler loves eine able to walk around in it the only thing it needs is a cover of some sort for the zipper something to make it harder for babies to undo the zipper 
5 5 love it so cute fun 
5 5 i bought it as a gift for an expectant mom and i believe it will be perfect for organizing her car 
5 5 holds the perfect amount of wipes for long trips but fits really easily into the diaper bag 
5 5 my baby likes it good
5 5 bought it as a gag gift for christmas it came in early and the product worked as expected 
5 3 the free mirror isn t as pictured it s tiny and a worthless piece of junk false advertising by the vendor amazon please look into this the seat is completely awesome 
5 5 this is truly good for the toddler beginning to learn how to brush
5 5 very convenient and roomy lightweight and can fit a ton of stuff in her so happy with purchase
5 5 i am very pleased with the diffuser it is everything it was described to be very soothing relaxing and quiet 
5 5 these are beautiful and will go with anything especially darker wood very sturdy and safe 
5 5 outstanding 
1 2 bought theses in december 2014 and now its may 2014 these covers you buy at your own peril these seemed to have failed protecting my seats the blue parts give way over time and can bend and become disconnected from the material maybe its because of i have graco carseats i dont know i just know that it seems to have a longevity problem now ive got to spend money on another product that can last longer 
5 5 i have no issues with this mattress my daughter isn t a very picky baby but she sleeps very well on it just the right about of firmness not extremely firm and not too soft and it s waterproof 
5 5 this is the best baby product we have the thing has fit onto every single table we ve tried it on our own dining room table where it usually sits saves space restaurant tables kitchen islands and the tables at her grandparents houses best part is that now that baby is 9 months and feeding herself and making incredible messes we can take it apart and throw the cover in the washing machine the nylon air dries super quickly it s incredibly sturdy and took most of my body weight on the back of it when i leaned on it to check it before we put the baby in it i love this thing great product super convenient beautiful to look at so it s really about both form and function a fantastic product that i ve already bought for other friends having babies folds up in a jiffy and fits right into the attached carrying bag so i don t have to go hunting for the bag or fear losing it every time we take it out with us this thing is incredible the tray fits great and washes fast too what a fabulous product literally the best designed baby product i ve ever used 
5 5 great product high quality and works like a charm 
5 4 i bought this to take my infant seat and base on a trip and gate check them the bag came back scuffed with a tiny hole which is all damage my car seat would have endured without it i m also glad it kept gross airline germs off my car seat i wish it was slightly sturdier material i think this will only last another couple of flights before we replace it with a new one but honestly for the price i guess that s fine even though the picture shows a convertible upright seat it will hold an infant seat and base i m convinced this is the reason the airline didn t lose my car seat 
5 5 worked great 
5 5 earths answer 100 natural wool dryer balls jumbo size largest currently available 4 the dryer balls by earths answer are well made and extra large i normally use three to four smaller plastic balls for normal size load but i have used all 4 balls but i have only found it necessary to use two of these with a normal load but it is nice to use 4 with the towels and sheets they just come out so soft i have used them several times and they have held up well and my clothes are dryer in a lot less time i was skeptical as i have issues with wool but these balls are strong and have held up to the dryer i have tried other style and types of dryer balls and they were good but i have never had anything like these and i sure hope the last a long long time because they are just super and when it comes to saving money that is always a major plus i received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review all opinions are 100 my own and they reflect my honest unbiased opinion 
5 4 simple enough does what i need it to do minus one star cause it isnt wide enough to fit the 8oz dr brown bottles in with nipple cap have to keep them stored seperatly in the basket till ready to use 
5 5 this item is made of really thick and sturdy material i used it on the edge of a wooden bed the tape provided with the product is sturdy and keeps the protector snug and tight it is difficult for the kids to pull it out i think the item works well for what it is advertised for i like the build quality and is not cheaply made a must have if you especially have 2 kids as they are always running around and pushing each other 
5 5 beautiful finish and coordinate well with any decor 
5 5 perfect size
5 5 good price and it came fast thank you 
5 5 they are huge and cover to his pants which is perfect cause he drop food in the high chair all the time perfect and cute a little pricey but very bright and colorful 
3 2 wife and i read all the glowing reviews bought it and ended up really not liking this backpack we ve had it for 2 years our complaints was bag layout and floppyness we never used the built in wipes pocket it is easier to grab a bag of new wipes than refill it the top shallow pocket was useless items would fall out of it easily the bag is soft it d just fold on itself all the time we prefer backpacks that are a bit more rigid everything would just pile up into a mess at the bottom the pockets aren t logically laid out the smallest is in the front so you d think the roomiest is in the back but it s actually the third pocket that holds the most the final fourth pocket is a tiny one for keys and a cell phone but it took us a while to stop going into that one thinking it s the biggest the shoulder straps are pretty uncomfortable they re scratchy not padded and when the bag gets heavy with clothes and water bottles it gets downright painful to wear after a while they pull somewhat awkwardly and i d slide the bag partway off my shoulders to relieve the discomfort this is not one of my best reviews but i wanted to put it out there because there is a big gap between what we expected and what we got 
5 5 great saves the sheets doesn t leak 
5 5 amazing our 4mo old is loving walks now we used the car seat but he was never really comfortable in it this has made a huge difference wish we had bought it earlier 
5 5 love the cover and the color my son keeps grabbing at the material while feeding and it s a bit hot in a hot and humid climate like singapore but i have remained covered and can see what s going on beneath 
5 4 works just great 
5 5 very nice 
4 5 i brought this bag in intentions to carry all of my reusable menstrual pads it worked greatly even with my collection growing i still always have room in this bag however one 34 con 34 is that it doesn t keep heavy odors out well enough good enough though i still love it nice and waterproof no leeks however i haven t really tested that but a great bag 
1 3 i wish i could give this swing 5 stars my baby girl loves it i bought this for my lo who is still in the nicu the nurses and my lo love it but recently after about month and half of use the battery compartment doesn t work tried changing the batteries 3 times to no avail so i hauled this thing home and tried plugging it up to see if it s the motor it works perfectly plugged up just not on batteries it s disappointing because now my lo can t use it in the nicu because they have rules about plugging up swings and gliders going to try and contact graco if that flops i ll have to return it to amazon i hope not because my baby girl loves it but i do have to say the music is awful the speakers are poor quality my baby just like the nature sounds
5 5 cute
5 4 the best car seat to my daugther 
5 5 i finally got my daughter to brush her teeth she loves snacking on bananas and such if i was a 2 year old i might ve brushed more 
5 5 i love this calendar it s beautiful gender neutral and a great keepsake it s so easy to jot things down quickly so i can remember my baby s milestones firsts likes dislikes schedule etc it s much easier to record than an actual baby book i have the matching book which is beautiful but i haven t touched it this on the other hand is in use often i m glad i have it as this time is going so fast i would most definitely forget some of these memories if i didn t have it 
5 5 always a great product 
5 5 really nice gift would definitely recommend loved the teddy bear and the blanket is very soft 
5 5 love these pacifiers 
5 5 love it very well made material 
5 5 this is the only pacifier our daughter will use we love it
5 5 very nice product baby loves it 
5 5 as expected
5 5 my daughter loves it 
5 5 only pacifier my baby would take we tried them all 
2 1 the sound on the monitor often cuts out so we don t even know if the baby is crying at night additionally the camera screen started to get fuzzy after just 3 months also don t like that you can t adjust the camera left right or up down from the monitor 
5 4 great bag for one kid awesome pockets feels a little narrow would love if was wider 
5 5 very good my niece loves it 
1 2 this is not what i thought
5 5 thank you 
5 5 i bought these for my nephew he s 7 months now and for the past 2 he s been able to hold these well they have places for little hands to grab and the colors are bright i recommend these 
5 5 excellent
5 5 love it prompt shipping 
5 5 this is such a why didn t i thinkof that product perfect for schlepping my wiggly 2year old through airports on international flights 
5 5 awesome these give me so much ore space in my dish washer and the parts lok cleaner too it has a spot for the bloe valves at the botom of the bottle too 
5 5 first of all i received this 5 days earlier than i expected as a first time mom i want the best for my little one many recommended this for me my little one is due in 6 weeks so i don t know if it s good or not but i ve been doing a lot of research it seems like it is 
5 1 i purchased these bottles to replace my 8 months old dr brown bottles because they were dripping everywhere i was tired of it i do like that when the nuby bottles are laid on their side or upside down they do not drip however that being said my daughter can t drink them because she chokes the nipple flow is way too fast i feel like it d be appropriate for an adult she takes one 34 suck 34 and she s gasping for air and turning dark red and can t breathe because it s coming out so fast awful i will not recommend these to anyone 
1 1 terrible stopped working after less than a month 
5 4 sheets shrink
5 5 simple and cute 
5 3 beautiful and soft but pilling already after only a couple of washes still love it 
5 2 the item was missing 1 out of 4 footing triplets and it had a lot of grease or oil on the footing pieces that i had to clean with dawn soap before it came off the pieces also come lose very quick
5 5 i it 
5 5 fits pillow fine 
5 5 practical product 
5 5 i purchased this skirt from guilt at a cheaper price the quality is excellent it s perfect for more modern nurseries cribs matches well with my babyletto crib this skirt is similar quality with the babyletto skirt however it feels much smoother and look less wrinkled than the babyletto skirt once it is washed and dried 
5 4 absolutely love it
5 5 my little one loves this night light it s just enough light to soothe her and it has a 30 minute shut off timer which is very useful i like it because it has led lights and it s one touch operation 
5 3 not sure how long this booster seat will work for a big baby boy it was a gift
1 1 this is not at all for a newbirn the small is more for a toddler returning because way too big for our 1 month old
3 2 holds minimal small dolls not going to hold big or heavy stuffed animals i got it to work using jumbo picture frame hooks after putting tons of holes in my wall better putting a shelf if your landlord lets you use heavy screws on the wall 
4 4 i did not see it but my daughter in law said that it was nice
5 5 my daughter loves this color 
5 5 love it great size easly sanatized and washed very easy to handle 
5 5 my boy loves them easy transitioning between breast and paci no nipple confusion 
5 5 have used these for all three of our boys for some reason they seem to be able to keep it in their mouths more easily
5 5 great tried many pacifiers and these were my son s favorite
5 1 this is a hilarious and adorable pacifier there s no doubt but it is a huge safety risk we have only had ours a month and when i was washing it in the sink the nipple came detached from the base if this had happened in my wee ones mouth he could have sucked it back and choked buyers be wary there s no way the cute photo will be worth your kid s safety
5 4 too slow at reading temp
5 5 this was a baby shower gift and she loved it 
5 5 best pacifiers available only thing to be aware of is that this is an infant pacifier meaning they are easily chewed up once your child has teeth :)
5 5 my baby with four months loves this pacifier 
5 4 paci bag is wonderful i use it to hold a clean back up paci in the diaper bag or my purse the large bag isn t quite as bit as i had hoped but it still holds about 5 cloth diapers i actually ordered two sets of these one for diapers and a second to keep for wet dirty clothes recommend these for sure 
3 5 cute idea
5 5 very cute i love it
5 2 the baby took this only one time and then refused it another friend said the same thing happened with her baby 
5 5 my kiddo is obsessed these are the best 
5 5 just a described and received when promised 
5 5 great purchase 
5 5 although my suga mama is way too old for this pacifier it is soooo cute and i love when she says where is her herraife we did loose it but it was way worth it 
5 5 haven t used this yet as baby comes in sept but yhe idea is fantastic i saw this on shark tank and ordered it while the episode was still on 
5 5 price is good these are nice to have on hand 
5 5 the glow in the dark feature is great 
5 5 this item was shipped just as cute as it was pictured online and i already told new mothers to purchase it cause i work in a hospital thanks
5 5 my baby started using at two months much better than havana brand round nipple is most like my nipple so deters less from breastfeeding the rubber is much more pliable and soft the mouthpiece is much bigger than all other pacifiers my baby prefers it it stays in her mouth better and more imitates how the breast fits in her mouth sits at the back of mouth very happy with product and hard couple days when we lost it and had to use whatever natural rubber brand local store carried until new ecopiggy was delivered 
5 5 good
5 1 my daughter hates these pacis she refuses to use them because the nipple is too big i don t know how other babies like them but they were a huge miss in my house 
2 3 didn t work for my baby :(
5 5 my daughter really liked this since she didn t have one for her first pregnancy looks to be a safer way to dispense medicine 
5 5 they are great to have
5 5 all my kids have loved these things it makes it easier for babies to find and grab it if they drop them in their car seat or crib we ve even cut the pacifier end off when the kids got older so they could keep sleeping with the animal 
5 5 gave as gift loved it 
5 5 a life saver 
5 5 perfect for babies that don t like silicone nipples i ve had the paci for a month now and my child prefers to gum it down it better than nothing and it is still intact 
5 5 these are way more expensive than the soothies we usually buy but we think they are totally worth it for the laughs alone these pacifiers are good quality and they even come with covers so they don t get dirty 
5 5 best pacifier made in germany btw 
5 4 great pacifier for a baby i m a first time mom so i mostly get the essentials from a trusted brand like dr browns my baby though never learned to use the pacifier i am not sure if this is because we breastfeed 
5 5 these phillips avent soothie pacifiers were the only kind that my daughter would use my wife and i received several different kinds from baby showers but my daughter would just spit them out and fuss even more than before i don t know what it is about them that she likes so much but they work wonders for calming her down i also prefer these over others because of their simple design which makes cleaning and sanitizing easy fyi my daughter is 3 months old and we have been using these from week 1 if she changes her preference on pacifiers at any point i ll be sure to update this review 
1 2 very cute toy but baby does not like the pacifier the pacifier is the soothie type they use in hospitals which never stays in her mouth so this purchase is useless 
5 1 do not use these my daughter loved these from the time she was born until she was two and it ruined her teeth and her bite she has a cross bite now and the dentist says she is going to need a ton of orthodontics when she gets older i thought it was no big deal at first and would just impact her baby teeth wrong a pacifier can change the way the teeth grow in and a child s bite and adult teeth are going to come in the same way the baby teeth are if you use a pacifier i highly recommend using one with a better shape that won t impact the teeth as much you can read descriptions of other pacifiers that will say things like 34 promote healthy oral development by naturally fitting into your baby s palate 34 do your research wish i did 
5 4 very good
5 5 baby loves them and the glow in the dark makes them slightly easier to find 
5 3 it s ok
5 4 great on the go in the stroller in the car it keeps the pacifier in and my baby holds and cuddles with it does not work much when the baby is falling asleep and turns her head to the side the pacifier won t stay in 
5 5 cute and fun something soft to hold onto and easy to clean 
5 5 my son loves the wubbanub it s so easy for him to grab and put back in his mouth and it s easy to keep track of and they are so cute 
5 5 excellent product
5 5 excellent product
1 1 i order the green pacifier and when it arrived to my house it was white and had a duck on it really disappointed because i wanted the green one 
5 4 love wubbanubs just think they are a bit overpriced for what they are 
5 5 perfect game for the kids in a baby shower
5 5 my granddaughter loves her wubbanub so i always buy 2 for the baby showers i am invited to so far my favorites are the elephant the lamb and the christmas reindeer 
5 5 my son loves it 
4 5 by far the only bottle she likes no complaints 
5 5 i love these little mam pacifiers they are curved so they fit babies face instead of poking away from the face this makes it less likely that the baby will yank the pacifier out of her mouth also because there is no 34 ring 34 attached to the front that also makes it less likely that the baby will yank it out of her mouth since these are for 0 6 month old babies they are smaller on the outside and the nipple they suck on is also smaller so it does not gag them like the bigger ones i have had a hard time getting my 4 month old to take the pacifier and this one works the best out of all the various types we have tried we have tried about 6 different types sizes brands 
5 5 best pacifiers ever 
5 5 as always love our wubbies :)
5 5 excellent product
4 4 heavy duty sturdy i only gave 4 stars because i couldn t get it to stick to the wall in one of my showers it is tile so perhaps it isn t made for that type of surface delivered on time 
5 5 this chair is awesome it s so comfortable i bought this for my daughter and she just loves it 
5 5 these were recommended by our eating therapist to help my 8 month old move his tongue when he eats we love them too bad they are discontinued 
5 3 got this for my 2 1 2 year old seat works fine but the tray is too small for how much she likes to eat and for many of her plates and bowls the tray also does not slide on as smoothly as i would like especially if you already have food on the tray 
2 3 looks like it can break easily specially from the flexible union it s very thin on this area i think it is overpriced but it holds 2 small pacifiers at one time 
5 5 my daughter love this walker i had to order another for the babysitter s house 
4 5 this mirror has been great i have had other mirrors that i have purchased from stores near by and found them to be cheaply made or the mirror was flexible and warped the reflection to make it hard to use this one straps on easily and is very secure i have a small suv and have no problem seeing my son in the back seat the swivel mount is sturdy and seems to stay in place but does lack a little in rang of motion but doesn t detract from the product i gave it 5 stars because i feel that it is great for the price and what it does 
5 5 excellent fit easy to clean provides protection for cream leather seating 
5 5 the design is very simple and the quality is very good 
5 5 adorable 
5 5 i bought these the first time when i had my oldest son and he loved it he refused to take any other pacifier i purchased them again for my second and he loves them too 
5 5 excellent product just as described arrived as expected will definitely buy more to add to our wubbanub collection 
5 5 they are very soft and natural feeling my baby loves them highly recommended haven t found other pacifiers better than these 
5 5 wonderful button glows almost all night long so i can find it in the middle of the night 
5 5 excellent product
5 5 my daughter is 3 months and she loves her kitty this is the only paci she can put back in her mouth herself when it falls out and hold in place she s still developing her motor skills do she can t always get it in but i don t have the problem where the paci falls on the floor :)
5 5 great pacifiers love the colors 
4 3 my little one wasn t a big fan of this pacifier but i did like that it came in a case for sanitizing 
5 5 bought as a gift so haven t really used it 
5 1 i was originally excited to see these available my son could find his binki without needing assistance but i should have known that would be too good to be true first you have to put it in the sun to be activated which with a new baby i could not remember to do but secondly and most importantly it only glowed for 10 minutes what is the point of that we use it just as a normal binki 
5 3 one had a hole in it the other was fine and my 6 week old likes it 
5 3 my little one wasn t a big fan of this pacifier 
5 5 the 0 6 were too big these are a good deal smaller great price for 4
5 5 these are excellent but make sure you only use them for girls as advertised using them with boys turns your boys into girls 
5 3 had a good time in my baby shower i ll cherish those moments but the eyes cover comes with very poor elastic that don t even fit kids head we used kerchief later on 
5 5 they are the 0 3 months just in case you were wondering
5 5 so cute 
5 5 fits a pacifier and nipple shield perfectly 
5 5 only ones my 5 week old will take right now
5 4 vanilla scent is great
5 5 my newborn girl loves this pacifier the first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home since the one they give are the standart blue with mam written on it i wanted something cute for my girl so i bought from another brand that looked way nicer but my baby wouldn t take it so i checked online and found these and i love that they re exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute 
3 4 liked that they were toted as healthier but unfortunately baby did not like them maybe the butterfly style would have been better however at their cost i haven t tried them yet 
5 4 this is the best pacifier fir breastfed baby just wish it would fit baby s face more comfortably 
5 5 i love love love wubbanub s we have seven babies in my family and they all have different ones this one was for my son he is no longer using binkies but this was the only one he would take ever we called him nigel great things for baby to hold onto and very easy to wash i always just put mine in the dishwasher over about 16ish months i bought 3 or 4 of them but totally worth it :)
5 1 leaves red mark on my daughter s face 
5 5 great bottles i ve never had leaking issues 
4 5 pretty good
5 5 super cute and easy to find 
5 5 these glow in the dark pacifiers have made our lives so much easier a toddler losing her pacifier in the middle of the night has resulted in screaming crying and more than just her upset at a god forseen hour now she can often find it herself and when she can t we are able to sneak in locate it pop it back in and sneak out before she fully wakes up and hits the point of no return ingenious now if they just had a gps sensor for when she walks around the house and throws it down somewhere 
5 5 good
5 5 love these pacifiers after nicu stay
5 5 i love this and it soooo cute i lose these ones less
3 3 unfortunately my baby doesn t really take it compared to other brands
5 5 i am obsessed with giving my son wubb a nubs and this little guy was an awesome stocking stuffer 
5 5 just under 20 for all 4 same ones at walmart and get 1 just under 5 just informing ya ll o 
5 5 great baby shower gift 
5 5 11 month old son loves this i bought this specifically for a long car ride after seeing on shark tank and this kept him occupied and happy for a good portion of the ride i ve also gotten several compliments on this from the teachers at daycare :)
5 1 very stiff not cuddly at all get the pink elephant brown monkey or tabby cat instead my daughter had them when she was an infant and loved them they were super soft 
5 5 my daughter loved this gift for my new granddaughter the cute little lamb helps the pacifier stay put close to the baby s mouth 
5 5 my son loves all the wubbanubs he has they are very convenient for me as well because they are easier to find then the regular pacifiers 
5 5 awesome daughter loves it it s her 4th one:)
5 5 loveeeeeee loveeeee loveeee my son loves it and it is so easy for him to find it during the night and it is cute
5 4 cute for kids when my son outgrew his binky i cut the binky off and he kept the dog as a toy
5 5 mams are the best pap paps out there if you re an inexperienced parent do yourself and your baby a favor and buy nothing but mams from now on 
5 5 my niece loves this brand of pacifiers and they are easy to find in the dark bonus 
5 3 i bought this because my daughter loves her monkey wubbanub and i wanted to make sure that she had a back up in case her monkey got lost i personally this is very cute it does look more like a sheep with long ears than a bunny but regardless its cute the body is not as long as the other wubbanubs i have seen and it is about 3 4 the size of one although i think it is my 10 month old daughter does not like this one at all i think it s because it s a little harder to hold than the monkey because the body is so short also the fabric is a little bit fluffier than the monkey so i think that it feels different to her as well although we still have this at home and she uses it occasionally we still try and give it to her she definitely prefers her monkey 
5 5 my baby loves mam pacis they seem to be easier for her to keep in her mouth another brand soothies always fall out like she s having trouble keeping them in these pacifiers are super cute and i love that they glow in the dark if she loses them at night it s easy to find them without turning on a light i would definitely definitely buy these again 
3 2 this would be a great toy paci if my baby had any interest in it whatsoever however she does not i have seen so many other babies with these but mine finds it useless as either toy or paci 
5 5 love these they re my favorite 
5 5 mams are the best pap paps out there if you re an inexperienced parent do yourself and your baby a favor and buy nothing but mams from now on 
5 5 we have tried what seems like every pacifier out there and this worked best for our baby we love it because it stayed in her mouth when she stopped sucking which helped her fall asleep soothing herself other pacifiers seemed to pop right out of her mouth the moment she wasn t actively sucking highly recommend 
5 5 so cute 
4 3 these pacifiers are great to avoid the gross crust that gets in the part where the nipple of a pacifier meets the hard plastic but my baby did not care for them which is why i give only 3 stars 
5 1 the bear i recieved was dark brown not as cute as this one pictured 
5 5 these were real life savers during last few months
4 4 unfortunately it seems very nice but my baby don t like
5 5 great service and love this product 
5 5 my grand daughter loved it
5 5 as you probably know most babies reject several kinds of passerfiers then finally settle on one that they like and you stop trying to find more these were it for our baby they are wider and flatter than most i think he liked that i like that there is no designated up or down makes putting it back in easier good luck 
3 1 the nipple is too small for the baby to keep it in his mouth 
5 4 not sure of the best way to clean sanitize these but very cute item 
5 5 traditional game
5 5 so cute what a great idea im going to get more 
2 2 it was good at the beginning but then it started to rip so i had to throw it away after like a week or so 
5 5 adorable
5 5 easy to clean no weird smell feels secure these are pretty similar to nuk pacifiers but i like the material better nice pacifier 
5 3 you only get two colors and they don t look like this false advertisement they have animals not the best designed animals on them they do work which was needed for a growing 6 mos baby if you use nuks these are similar but if you use the round pacifiers do not recommend i ordered that for an older baby will not take round pacifier
5 4 our baby loves this type of pacifier easy to hold onto and love the texture 
5 5 nice
3 5 ok
5 5 these pacifiers attach to a lot of clips my lo loved them 
5 5 nice
5 5 every kid is different but my little guy has loved his wubbanubs from day 1 he wraps his little hands around their legs he hugs it to his body we try any other pacifier and he spits it out even the soothies that are identical to the one attached to the wubbanub 
4 5 wish i would have thought of this first great idea but the price is a little ridiculous i think 
5 4 my son loves the dr
5 5 very handy
5 5 even when it comes to newborns especially when it comes to newborns when it hits the floor most of us wash it carefully and sometimes you just don t have the spare 2 minutes these pacifiers are shaped for safe soothing comfort the sanitary covers are a big plus when traveling 
4 5 these have a much softer texture than your standard binkie and i like that they don t have a bunch of mysterious plastic ingredients i do wish they would last longer though 
5 5 son loves these soothies we try to only give him the pacifier when he is so mad that we can t calm him down with walking rocking songs etc 
5 5 good
5 5 very cute was a baby shower gift 
5 5 my grandson loves it i like cows so he had to have it 
4 4 these are so much softer than what i was expecting my little guy really likes them i was very pleased to see that the soothie is a 0 6 month size i was afraid it was going to be the longer size and cause gagging the dragon is bigger longer than the lion we also got be aware it came packaged in a plastic bag not the stiff plastic cylinder like you see in the stores 
5 5 my son loves wubbanubs they are just big enough that he actually will hug them and holds them in place plus their extra size makes it easy to find even in the middle of the night or at the bottom of the purse 
1 1 i got pink ones not purple and green as it is shown on the picture it only bothers me because i am having a boy so pink would have been the last choice i pick even for pacis 
5 5 our baby girl loves this life saver the weight of the stuffed animal is the best quality of this product because if she pops it out of her mouth it stays put so it doesn t fall on the ground 
5 5 this sterilizer is a little pricey but i d say it is worth it if you can afford it i sterilize my baby s bottles daily and i love how easy it is the best part is that it offers a drying feature it is easy to operate and clean as well the sterilization cycle sometimes takes longer than 8 minutes my maximum has been almost 16 minutes so far which to me is alright the bottles come out clean dry and ready to use 
5 5 best pacifier ever
5 5 binky arrive ahead of time they are as described 
5 5 expensive but so worth it if you re looking for a safe pacifier 
5 5 love this little pacifier giraffe got it for my grandson and it is one of the things that is always near him in the stroller or in his baby swing so soft colorful and cute 
5 5 the best my daughter won t use any other pacifiers 
5 5 best pacifier to smooth your baby
3 3 great concept because i m a complete germaphobe and i don t want my son putting a dirty pacifier in his mouth i was really excited when i got this at my baby shower but it wasn t as great as i thought it is really bulky and wouldnt stay open well while my son used it it kept trying to close while in use and would pinch his face not to where it hurt or anything but it was still just obnoxious to keep having to reopen it for him 
5 1 the rubber part is hard as a rock and my baby never liked it
5 5 so handy to have on the diaper bag 
4 4 the product is good the only thing i didn t like is that you can t choose the color you want
5 5 good product and good seller
1 2 this monitor is horrible it loses the signal constantly within 10 feet of the nursery it has lasted for 15 months though so that s ok it also loses power within a couple hours of not being plugged in 
5 4 very comfortable and so easy to install one thing i find a bit troublesome is separating the seat from the back we currently have it installed with the back in our car however when my daughter carpools with someone else i usually just give her the seat alone so it s easy for her to put it in the someone s car so she can stay safe separating the seat from the back takes a bit of time and then putting it back on again is time consuming i also feel like the constant removal may wear out the locking system between the seat and the back i would recommend sticking with one way of using it i would still recommend it so far i have not been disappointed with any pegperego product i m hoping this booster will live up to expectations 
5 5 not going to lie it took a few minutes for our 1 month old baby to figure out how to use this nipple but once he did he had no problem downing the milk pretty quick at the moment we are only feeding him one bottle a day so he can get used to it for when i go back to work i was nervous because of all the negative reviews but this is working great for us so far as i said before though it will take some time for the baby to get used to it the first time you try it so don t give up right away 
5 2 i can t recommend this product particularly if you live in an arid environment such as the desert this does not keep the wipes moist i have had better results from other travel dispensers save your money 
1 1 zero stars didnt work total bummer don t buy 
4 4 nice and thin so that the harness can be safely fastened but it twists around the strap so that it has to be fixed every time to be facing the right way not stiff enough but it s soft and thin like i wanted 
5 5 good product and good seller
5 5 excelente 
5 5 good
5 2 the first time my grandson heard the sound of the flush and the song of congratulations he was totally terrified and won t go near the thing i turned off the sound but he still won t go near it what seemed really cute turned out to be a disaster my advice to the fisher price is to have a volume control knob or at least turn down the sound most children are not all hard of hearing one positive is that the blue lift off seat fits very snug and secure into the adult toilet seat i think that my grandson will be using that before he ever goes near the potty 
1 1 this is a total piece of junk i ve only used it for about 3 4 months and the red foam broke off in addition the hook shimmies itself to the side of the handles of the stroller awful product and poorly designed i thought the heart was cute but it s so not cute when it comes to functionality 
5 5 the crib mattress was a perfect for the crib i feel very comfortable that my grandbaby will sleep comfortably and safely on this mattress 
4 5 it does what it s supposed to i would buy one for a friend of they didn t have one i m sure you can use it for other brands than britax but the fact that they crash test with these is important to me it holds well and protects the seats to install you just set it on the seat and plop the base on top of it easy other reviewers commented on a smell but ours smelled fine like a new pair of shoes no complaints 
3 3 wanted to like it but after one wash it is not as soft as it was pre wash otherwise alright cute design 
1 1 our mattress sagged significantly after only three months of use for an infant weighing less than 12lbs amazon customer service was very helpful in expediting our return 
5 5 adorable boppy cover 
5 5 love it just wish it had a messenger strap 
5 5 what a great toy my nephew absolutely loves it i like it because it s safe and durable fda approve too my sister mom would not have it any other way lol highly recommended fast shipping excellent service 
5 5 these are a fantastic fantastic deal when it comes to pocket diapers i love them and have had no issues with them 
5 2 i ordered this thinking it was black nope it s brown deceiving picture 
5 5 so cute my babys love these i think probably because it s got a stuffed animal my son s love to cuddle it 
5 3 fun game but you have to cut out the pacifiers to pin on the baby yourself and then provide your own tape 
1 1 sent pink ones i have a boy colors may vary did not say girly binkis or boy binkies very unhappy can t use them no contouring to them either like a fat fingeri n his mouth
5 4 love this type of pacifier this one is a little floppy though my daughter uses it but the bear is better 
5 5 i put two of them in my tub they stay in place very well always check the stability before putting weight on it 
5 4 i ordered for my grandson s birthday and it looks very nice in his remodeled bedroom it hasn t been washed yet so unsure of how it will hold up 
5 5 my little monkey finally got his first cold so i got to see this bad boy in action well it works and he hates it but it works so much better then the bulb its deff a pump sucking kinda thing i cant explain it anyway i never added tissue and i also never got sick as some said but it was just a cold 
1 2 product is basic it works for what we need i ordered dark blue and was sent light blue got a very obnoxious borderline rude email from sender insisting on giving her a 5 star review 
5 5 love this i started my daughter off in this at 3 months old and she loved being able to see everything at the grocery store and i loved being able to shop with just a cart as opposed to cart and stroller or cart with car seat in it she moves her arms and legs a lot in excitement when she is in this so she is getting exercise too now she is 8 months and it still works great adjusts easy easy to put on front and outward facing it gets a little warm though from sharing body heat so i don t think this is a great thing for summer 
5 4 i use this for my preschooler s toddler bed for the price the quality isn t bad he seems to sleep comfortably on it 
5 5 beautiful 
1 1 first we loved this playard even though it had a very strong plastic smell in the beginning it is spacious and fun for a baby but as a lot of reviews mentioned the bottom mat doesn t stay flat and keeps getting up not only are there waves of material but the wooden boards inside started to overlap even though we never once disassembled it it has always stayed in one place with the occasional dust wiping we returned it after some time we found this playard inconvenient and potentially dangerous for a baby who is rolling over and just starting to crawl 
5 5 i scoured the reviews of all the other top reusable pouches out there of this size and decided to try these i m glad i did and don t have any complaints so far after using them regularly for many weeks pros you can t beat clear they are relatively easy to close no leaks so far they are super easy to fill they can use tops that come on the store bought pouches stock up while you re still using them super easy to clean and fit a standard bottle brush easily they do not hold food stains even tomatoes i forgot a blended spaghetti and meat sauce pouch in the fridge for a week and thought i d have an orange stained bag for sure nope no food residue or color was left behind with a normal washing really really impressive my 17 month old can hold it no problem it is difficult to make a mess with these you d have to step on it or make the contents pretty watery in order for stuff to leak out if it drops it s strong thick plastic it s big enough to feed an adult as well as a hungry kid cons the only con is that it can be difficult for my toddler to empty the bag without help since it s relatively rigid plastic i usually just squeeze the bottom fold it in half and wrap a hair tie around it to hold it so the stuff doesn t fall to the bottom of the bag where he can t suck it out i don t see this as a design flaw though it seems expected for a larger sized bag of higher quality and thicker plastic 
5 5 this is perfect
5 3 the cup is cute and well designed the only bad thing is the outside color is faded and mixed after several times washing 
5 2 is very large will not fit a 3 month old or newborn also has faint odor of dog or something else probably sized for a 9 12 month old hat looks well made blanket very loose and probably as pictures i just didn t looks close enough i won t be able to use either one 
5 5 so far i love it definitely like it better than the nosefrida one that i had before love the carrying case so convenient the soft tip for the baby s nose how small it is no filters needed and its easy peasy to clean i am planning on buying this as a baby shower gift for all the new mamas and probably one more for myself so i can have one for the diaper bag and one on the changing table :)
1 1 it was terrible i liked the design how it cleaned nipple however the sponge started to fall apart within a week that i was using i had very similar one purchased from oversea and it lasted really long time i would not buy this product again i was trying to get hold of the company s customer service for the quality but it was impossible to reach them it was very inexpensive nipple cleaner but i would expect it last more than a week :(
5 2 we are loyal oxo tot household we love all their products but this one we did not the rubber on the lid is now bent weird and doesn t hold the food in as well i put puffs in it for my son one time and him putting his hand in and out of the rubber to get the puffs bent the rubber and now basically it s just an open hole a tad disappointed but i think this would happen with any product with this type of lid 
5 5 i ordered this recipe book as it was a much better value saved quite a lot there are a lot better of smoothie recipes in there so have a large choice 
5 5 works great
5 5 lovely quality holds up well to the frequent washing that is inevitable with a baby the colors stay true and the material doesn t pill like cheap clothing 
5 5 perfect as described loved the colors pattern and design 
5 5 very nice item definitely a cut above cheap pacifiers natural materials make a huge difference my baby girl likes it 
5 5 i love how the mattress pad has deeper pockets so it goes easily over the mattress i would definitely recommend this to everyone 
5 5 absolutely love these cups i ve bought them for everyone i know that has toddlers 
5 5 soft and cuddly the blanket is so soft and could be used all year long 
5 5 excelente 
5 5 product as described
5 3 very mixed feelings on this bought for a baby shower and it was the most talked about gift some thought the womb idea was great others not on board behind the theory of this most of us have forgotten what being inside a womb sounds like some felt this sounded like a heavy breather on a late night phone call it also goes on and on it should look more like the energizer bunny after a few weeks of use no evidence that it works one way or the other he is cute and cuddly 
5 5 these weren t for me it was a present for someone expecting a newborn but she seemed pleased with them cute and conveniently stored and bpa free 
5 4 these pacifiers are great they come in a set of two are smaller than regular pacifiers which is great for newborns have a handy cap to keep it clean while not in use and are dishwasher safe i love the soft feel of the pacifier and the case can be kept for storage they are very durable and i ve noticed philips makes high quality baby food items across the board the little apple logo is attractive you probably only need the one set but a pair is very handy so you have a spare when one inevitably falls on the floor 
5 5 like it perfect for baby s little toys and pacifier 
5 4 this has been super useful our son was constantly getting his limbs stuck in the crib rails and would get very upset now we have the peace of mind that he ll stay contained within the crib yet isn t in danger of suffocating from the liner it was a little difficult for me to figure out how to align properly but it s stayed in place very well even with daily tugging and kicking at bedtime :)
3 4 ok
5 5 love the quality and design of these crib sheets 
5 5 there are the cheap car seats and then you have the heavy ones like diono for my kids i would not trust anything less than diono since the car seats need to hold safe the car set is very comfortable for kids compared to a cosco they had earlier if you have a compact car this will occupy a considerable space on your back seats it is heavy
5 5 my son loves this kids table and chair set it was very easy to put together and is the perfect height for his age 
5 4 please read the fine print carefully this is the mocha i did not read the fine print and just went by the picture this is the mocha version of the swing it is different than the picture shown i was frustrated to find that i had been sent a different color than what i wanted it is my own fault for not reading the fine print i would not like this to happen to any of you that is the main reason i write this review i ended up keeping the swing because the colors are pretty too the swing is great my baby girl loves her swing she sleeps very comfortably and i love the safety straps 
5 5 it was a gift
5 5 excellent all
5 5 the best of best i recommend 100 
1 1 these are the cheapest bibs i have ever owned do not waste your money after washing them they have holes all around the neck very cheap
5 5 awesome as others have stated install upside down my son is no longer able to open the doors and the lock stays in place unlike the type that attach with sticky strips highly recommend 
5 5 i won the sarah wells 34 annie 34 bag in a giveaway at the end of last year while i was still expecting and waited to write the review until i had a pump and could give a full in action review i love this bag just out of the bag it is classy and looks like a nice work shoulder bag not like a pumping bag now that i ve been using it for about two weeks i feel the same it holds my pump and all the accessories needed for a day of pumping and also some of my work files and additional stuff it is a great bag and i m so glad that i have it to use it s so much easier to be able to carry one bag and maybe a purse if i need a larger one than it was with my first child when i had the pump bag a work bag and a purse i have even used this one with my pump in it as a diaper bag too for anyone who is going to be needing to carry a breast pump and need a professional looking bag this is a fabulous option 
5 5 my son loves it it s worth the purchase 
4 4 does the job for the price
1 1 this product is so disappointing the clay is so messy and sticky and impossible to use it sticks to your hands and the plastic wrap it s in and the rolling pin what a waste of money 
5 5 our go to sleep sack easy to zip and cool enough for warmer months 
5 5 love this product i have a child but decided to use it in a big bag to organize my camera and lenses 
5 4 granddaughter loves them
5 5 beautiful crib fairly easy to assemble promptly arrived on my door step highly recommend totally worth the money 
5 5 softest fleece i have ever felt and i love the color i know my niece will love it when she is born 
5 1 can t for the life of me get this on the bottle classic case of great in theory 
5 5 this blanket is almost 4 years old and my daughter is still carrying it around this is the blanket that became her security blanket it is still in great condition aside from the dingy coloring and softness loss over time 
5 5 product arrived two days earlier and in great condition box came with an extra pair of batteries haven t tried those yet the train illuminates quite nice just the right amount so you can distinguish all the train details 
5 5 works well
4 4 looks nice but collects dirt hard to clean but a major step up over the primary colored alphabet pad 
5 5 i love these bags they are thick and freeze well as long as they are fully closed they do not leak thawing milk is easy in these too and they keep the milk fresh i hated the l bags i felt they were too thin and flimsy so i tried these and haven t looked back since 
1 1 i bought this because i had read reviews that it would work on a brick hearth it turned out to be a complete waste of my money the tape it came with is in fact very sticky but not nearly enough to work i am back to square one minus the money i wasted if you are concerned about tabletops and the like this is a good choice 
5 3 i used them once for my daughter and the applesauce juice leaked out of the bottom pretty messy to deal with
5 5 my kudos love using this pillow when they are 34 camping 34 in their blanket forts it is small and easy to move from place to place and has retained its fullness over the course of several months thank you 
5 5 typically this is for babies but as a post cancer patient i occasionally get a sore jaw and teeth i decided to try it out and see if it would help any at all it did it took awhile for me but yes it works for adults too i have always believed in the value of stones and their properties amber is one of the best there is i give it 5 stars and now that i have met someone that has a baby i will be passing it along thanks powells owls for making this i received these for free in consideration of a product review however my opinions are my own and no one else s 
3 3 they seem fine but my breastfed baby hated them he prefers a different type of pacifier 
3 3 the color is not exactly what i expected 
5 5 i already have one but bought a second for our second changing area you don t realize how well these work until you try using a regular trash can for a diaper garbage 
5 5 great booster great price
5 5 easy to use and good taste 
5 5 he loves it 
5 5 works perfect holds all my son s stuffed animals perfectly above his bed 
5 5 i got this today my baby isn t here yet but so far i am really happy with this bassinet it was easy enough to set up and looks like it will be perfect for next to the bed i plan to use the cover to make sure my cat doesn t try to jump in but i think it will also be great for the summer if we ever want to just sit out on the porch or take a trip to the park the pad that comes with this is not terribly thick but i think it is perfectly fine for a baby i ordered a bassinet mattress to go with this but i don t think i ll keep it and will send it back the one that comes with it recommends not to use additional padding as it could be unsafe if it does not fit properly or is too soft i d rather be safe and just use the one that comes with it i really don t think she s going to be spending the majority of her time in there anyway overall so far i m happy with this purchase the color is what i expected and could be used for a boy or girl the quality is good and the product is pretty much what i was expecting if anything changes i ll update my review 
5 5 perfect for my 4 year old and my big boys 12 16 like them too
5 1 i bought these to use on my son when he was about 18 months old and i also bought a different brand at the same time i did not like the piyo piyo ones they are too thick and have a rough edge that i really don t like for getting a clean gentle cut i can t imagine trying to use these on a newborn or infant i don t even like using them on myself 
5 5 i received this as a gift and i really like it my problem was that when i use our little folding portable stroller to take our baby girl on a walk in the park or in the mall there s no place to store anything on the stroller so i m stuck hefting the diaper bag and my purse as well but this item is basically a sturdy fanny pack that attaches to the handles of the stroller without getting in the way of where i hold it it can hold my drink baby girl s bottle easily all the contents of my purse cell keys lip gloss wallet and more and it still doesn t feel bulky i also like that the pocket for the cell phone is right in front so i can see when i get texts it s definitely more comfortable to stroll with baby girl without carrying anything extra and this organizer helps me do that 
5 2 these are made for giants seriously the pads are so so big they also don t stick well why make a pad that s huge but then have only one sticky piece on it 
5 1 too harsh for baby
5 5 lies flat and baby loves it 
5 4 good product
5 5 very good
5 3 this pillow is smaller than most but that is what i prefer about it it easily tucks into a diaper bag for travel and it is just big enough to give a little boost while nursing my daughter and i have used this since she was a newborn and she is now six months old i had a boppy with my son but stopped using it early because it was so big and cumbersome i have used the free coupon for the cotton fabrics and they rip through the middle after about three months of use hence the star rating but i continue buying them because they are the only nursing pillow this size which i find practical and convenient it also works well to prop baby up when she was very little does great in the washer and dryer 
5 5 came quick and its as shown
5 5 my baby loves these can always find her paci in crib at night helps to self soothe so we don t have to get up and find it for her even when she is not sucking on it she cuddles w it we have two we also stick in freezer for her teething 
5 5 my baby s pacifier kept falling out of his mouth in the car seat so i ordered this hoping to help keep it near his mouth for him to find when it does fall out he loves it and it s worked well so far
3 3 for the price it s an ok last minute stroller but the wheels are pretty useless unless you are just going straight
1 3 not a very thick jersey knit normally i would associate jersey knit with a thick stretchy material this was indeed stretchy but so thin that i could see through it in spots had to return it return was fast though so no complaints there 
5 5 love these burp cloths they are super absorbent and soft and they fit nicely on your shoulder 
5 2 food falls through very messy and the blue one is stained by the food not sure if that s normal 
5 5  videoid be4b19e8c85d0d4abe41f0ce4c383081 just what i needed to keep all of my babies memories safe this is a cute plastic case that closes to open it you have to press the button it comes with a memory book files information cards and labels the memory book has pages for special dates events ocassions so all you have to do is fill it in i like that it has lil envelopes to keep important documents you want to save the files can be used for vaccination records insurance papers ect nice for keeping all of babies things in one place i received this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest review 
5 5 very well pleased and baby too 
5 5 must have for nursing moms 
5 5 this is a neat baby bed i love that we can roll it from room to bed it fits very nicely through the door frame we ve found it works amazingly well with the baby monitor we just aim the monitor at the mirror end and we can see the whole bed clearly i like the smaller size since our granddaughter only visits occasionally and this is very easy to store the mattress is a nice thickness and fits snugly in the bed couldn t be happier with the purchase 
5 5 my grandson loves his new batman car seat good quality 
5 5 this is a nice set that would make a nice baby shower gift or a gift for a new mom it comes with bottles of different sizes including one with handles it also comes with a few pacifiers and brush and a formula set since new moms often need a variety of bottles this is a nice set for the kids it is bpa free which is important i found the quality to be very was easy for the baby to drink from i like the blue color i thought it made it pretty and would be good for a little boy baby although it s obviously fine for girls as well i like how much came with this set this also is made to grow with the child 
5 5 using this on trips well made and lots of pockets my daughter loves using it to organize and pack all of her stuff 
4 2 my two week old son loves to have some kind of noise on and he sleeps very well with such however this 34 sound machine 34 is not close to being loud enough for him to hear clearly there is a manual volume adjustment knob but even with it turned all the way up it is merely a soft noise you can hear it clearly when it s silent and he is already drifting off to sleep which completely defeats the purpose the design and construction is great but the volume is my only problem it is a cute and very soft animal which is the only reason i m keeping it since i hate dealing with returns overall i regret my decision to buy this as i never would spend 35 on just a stuffed animal i have already purchased a separate sound machine in hopes that it will do a better job 
5 5 great bottles i handwash the nipples because one discolored from our water in the dishwasher i put them through a microwave sterilizer afterwards we have well water so we have to use boiled water or sterilize to kill any possible bacteria 
5 4 love our car seat it s not 34 cheap 34 feeling like some one the reviews said my son has plenty of room and is very comfortable in it i recommend it 
1 1 how did you install it i just did and it leaks or should i say sprays everywhere i don t want to return it but looks like i might :(
5 5 i done research for many days before buying this seat protector i have leather seats and wanted to be very careful to not ruin them from the car seat base or car seat protector this one is made very well and had nothing on the bottom that would hurt my seats i highly recommend it but it did not work for me unfortunately it does not fit my 2015 jeep patriot seats correctly my base is bigger than the seat protector 
5 5 my 5 year old son can put his seatbelt on easily and i feel safe knowing he s in the 5 point harness the quality of diono really beats out other car seats and is worth the price the buckles really prove to be more secure than other leading car seats 
5 5 really wonderful drool bibs i ve had many over the course of three kiddos and these are by far my favorite the wetness really doesn t soak through to the other side it is very very soft to rub against baby s sweet skin i have washed a dried and they have continued in great quality keeping perfect shape and they are adorable i highly recommend i would use these designs for both boy or girl will be giving as gifts 
1 1 these broke almost immediately 
5 5 great for saving toys from falling out of stroller or car seat 
5 5 good 
5 5 super happy i thought i only ordered one case but got 4 for this price look exactly like the picture and love the how they feel they fit perfect on my galaxy s4
5 5 good 
5 4 good
5 5 i have a 7 year old daughter and a 4 year old nephew and 3 year old niece that i knew would i enjoy this when i was given the opportunity to receive this awesome bath toy organizer and test it out and give my honest and unbiased opinion it shipped quickly and arrived as promised i knew that weekend there was going to be some happy little people at my house boy was i right the bath toy organizer is made well and plenty big enough to hold lots of bath toys it comes with and hangs by small suction cups the foam letters and numbers that came with it are just awesome they are so neat they will stick to the bathtub walls just by being wet they dry out fairly quickly and can be played with outside of the bathtub also its a great toy to have my littles love it 
3 5 i like it specially the smaller brush at the back side to walk nipples
5 5 excellent sleep sack for warm nights the material is like a thick soft t shirt and the wide top to bottom zipper and snaps on the shoulders make it easy to get on and off we like it so much we bought another we also have the regular thickness sleep sack for cool nights and highly recommend both they are worth the extra expense 
5 5 i love the original bumgenius elemental unfortunately they are hard to find and can be quite expensive if purchased new i heard about smart bottoms and that they were similar so i gave them a try now they make up the majority of my stash they are usa made soft absorbent organic cotton inner fast drying time for an aio the fit is great and thy come in cute colors and prints plus the re sale value is high can t go wrong with these 
5 4 i just so happened to pick one of these up while out of town i needed something as i was flying cross country with my son alone hallelujah this is the first carrier i ve been able to wear my 17lb six month old in happily we tried a mei tai a k tan and an ergo with no luck and lots of tears i wore him forward facing through 3 airports comfortably on both our parts i wasn t even sore the next day i didn t find it difficult to get him in and out or to get the carrier on myself though it wasn t my first rodeo i would certainly recommend this as a good alternative to the very similar and grossly more expensive brand the only thing that would make it better would be a pocket on the front for my id cash chapstick keys 
5 5 this thermometer is just wonderful to start things off the price is perfect it s not too expensive and the price is as good as the quality so it won t break after a few uses i love how it s infrared so it does not require end probe caps which can get pretty expensive with that being said it s pretty healthy just wipe it clean after use the size also makes it really portable which is wonderful for when you re taking long vacations you never know if you ll need it i d recommend anyone to get this thermometer 
5 4 it is nice and soft pillow but i don t know how i can fix this pillow 
5 5 two age spots on my face have disappeared after using this product for over a year now it absorbs into the skin feels nice not greasy 
1 4 it was not as thick as i like it to be so i returned it 
5 3 it s budget friendly super soft and really cute but the velcro across the front rubs and irritates my little guys belly 
5 4 my baby immediately found the little crinkle tags and laughed and laughed i really liked all the different textures and colors the little green rubber part picks up lint and hair like crazy so i m always rinsing it but i think my baby liked it even more when it was a bit damp 
5 5 my two year old loves his mickey backpack he s had it since christmas and uses it every day to transport his toys around no sign of any wear and tear literally no sign it s the best 10 i spent last christmas 
3 3 it s okay a lot smaller than i expected 
3 3 i had high hope for these pacifiers as we always struggle to find her binkies late at night it does not glow in the dark after turning off the light for 30 minutes it defeats the purpose of these glow in the dark pacifier not only that but it also too big the design is very awkward it does not mold to mouth no curves whatsoever i would not purchase these binkies again my daughter also hates these 
5 5 my daughter loves these and she can put them in her own mouth at only 4 months
3 4 i like them but my 5 month old doesn t care for the texture it s not matte like she s used to 
5 4 they get very dusty linty right away
5 5 i saw this on shark tank and bought it for my granddaughter who is expecting her first child can t wait to have her try it out 
5 4 muy bueno
5 5 super cute
4 3 yes it works the pacifier closes when falls down but the problem is that then the baby can t open it and put it in her mouth plus our baby choose on everything including on the parts of this pacy that touches the floor so it defeats the whole reason we got it n a first place but might work for someone else 
5 5 love these pacifiers i used these with my son when he was a baby almost 10 yrs ago and i always recommend them to breastfeeding moms 
5 5 both of my kids adore these pacifiers they are sturdy fit their mouths well and don t fall out easily they are cheaper to buy in store though so do that if you can to save a few dollars 
5 5 super cute pacifiers my baby loves them 
5 3 i like this and so did my baby until the cat stole it and chewed a hole in the nipple that s when i realized the pacifier can t be replaced much too expensive for a tiny toy 
5 3 granddaughter will take it briefly if nothing else is available but doesn t like it it isn t very soft or pliable like the softer silicone or latex ones it is all one piece which i usually love but for some reason it attracts every piece of fuzz and hair it finds because of the material it s made from stuff sticks to it her blanket s fuzz doesn t stick to any other pacifier but this one even her hair will get stuck to it so i wouldn t recommend it 
5 5 best pacifier my newborn could hold it in her mouth almost immediately 
5 5 i love these pacifiers my daughter has been using them since her first day of life and will refuse any of the traditionally shaped pacifiers they are a little difficult to keep in their mouth for the first few weeks of life but i prefer them over traditional binkies 
5 5 baby loves 
5 5 awesome easy to find and easy for my baby to hold on to he is now 6 months and uses it at sleep times only 
5 5 my daughter loves this type
5 5 we love wubbanubs 
5 5 great fits perfectly in the playpen
5 3 very small i have a 10 year old who is not even 80 pounds and they are small on her and to say they are legging pants is a bit misleading they are more like tights very thin and see through 
5 2 i would not recommend this product to anyone we love the design but when you see it in person it is very bad quality cheap materials 
5 2 it shrinks and has no shape after one wash 
5 5 i really like this belt for my son who s 18 months weighs 27lbs i like the ease of the belt and not having to worry about poking holes in belts that are too big 
5 4 installs pretty easy and my guy seems reasonably comfortable 5 years we had a marathon and choose the pioneer over the frontier due to limited space subaru outback and it fits well 
5 5 my husband and i had a miscarriage last year so when we realized we were pregnant this year we started searching for a baby monitor we could safely use to give us some peace of mind during the early mid pregnancy we asked our doctor about this product and he said it was safe as long as we didn t over use it so we didn t we only used it a couple of times a week for a max of 5 minutes sessions i was only 10 weeks when my husband and i started using it and though sometimes we could find the heartbeat immediately other nights we just had to give up looking after 5 minutes i read that you probably need to start using it later on in pregnancy but it worked for me on the 10th week :)
1 1 just received these today they are junk one of the earring shafts are bent the backs just slide up down defiantly not a screw on also cheaply made you can see a big glob of glue under the pearls where they have been glued on very disappointed 
5 5 my girlfriend tammy and i have been babysitting her grandniece claire for months we ve fed her using an entire family of philips avent classic plus bottles claire loves them because of the modern technology employed in the design of the nipple a valve built into the nipple has been designed to expel excess air back into the bottle rather than the baby s tummy the valve also works with the baby to allow him her to regulate the flow of the liquid therefore the valve prevents choking claire is a much happier baby at meal time she seldom cries when we feed her at the baby shower thrown for claire s mom theresa a multitude of different bottles were unwrapped of all the bottles tammy and i have used the philips avent classic plus baby bottles are the best they are extremely easy for us to clean because of fewer parts and larger openings most importantly claire loves them she has graduated from the four ounce to the nine ounce bottles and now she uses the eleven ounce bottles the eleven ounce bottles function just like the smaller versions 
5 5 lifesavers specially while outside 
5 5 it was perfect 
5 5 cute fitted sheet very happy with the purchase 
5 5 i am a mother to 5 including 12 week old twins this is my first time using bottles older kids breastfed exclusively so i started with the ones made by the pump manufacturer and used at the hospital one twin was having a tough time with those nipples so we switched to dr brown that twin seemed to do better with dr brown but the other twin didn t like those the nipple is narrow so i ordered these born free bottles both twins did so well with these i really like that they are wide mouth which makes cleaning easier although they do have five parts of you count everything separately it is so easy to take them apart and put them together really it only takes a few seconds that i personally don t consider it a problem whatsoever i think the system for preventing air gulping a highly effective and that and the nipples work so well i did move onto the glass version of these but still use the plastic and like to take the plastic in the diaper bag just because they re lighter i love both the plastic and the glass and highly recommend these to anyone i quickly put away all of the other brands and have been exclusively using the born free since about a week after i bought that first set 
4 2 a good snack plate but it s inability to be microwaved made it useless for us for now the non skid is nice and all in all it is a good product but we won t be able to use them until the kids eat solid foods which is a bummer 
5 5 this drying rack is fantastic it can hold so many bottles pump parts and pacifiers helps keep the clutter down to a minimum on the counter which is a huge help when bottle feeding 
5 5 love the size of this walker 
3 3 this is ok not really necessary to buy 
5 5 i ve never owned a baby monitor cam before but i know that there are a lot of brands out there with too much trouble this is the first one i veever owned and i m really happy about it i trust this brand and highly recommend it 
4 4 philips avent my natural drinking cup is a nice addition to the growing collection of drinking vessels in my world the handles are rigid enough to grab and hold because there is an open side it forces the child to actively grip and hold the cup but the plastic is not hard and rigid it gives a bit the design is pretty and feminine without the common cartoon styles and the drinking sipping area prevents spills while requiring thinking and drinking not just tip and sip 
4 5 work well my 17 month old daughter got the hang of it before i did 99 spill proof there have been a very few scenarios where there was some leakage but overall this cup performs very well i trust it to do the job 
5 4 love this my grandson thinks its great easy to get in and out of car plan to buy another one soon 
5 5 arrived on time and i loved it fabric is of good quality and covers car seat very well 
5 5 son loves easy for him to play with
5 5 use daily work great 
5 5 worked well with my cybex aton 2 car seat 
5 5 great product easy to install my daughters crib is next to an outlet that we put this on it has done its job ordered another one for the baby we are expecting now 
5 2 well it floats sort of this boat rides low in the waterline and has zero water proofing even on battery compartment which is pretty questionable any child or adult for that matter that attempts to interact with the boat while it is under way will inevitably sink it with very little effort the water cannon on the front produces an anemic stream like that of a pin prick in a pop can barely noticeable if you need a model boat for calm waters then this will do otherwise shop onward 
5 5 my 6 year old daughter loves this cup and frozen
5 4 you shouldn t use this in a car seat only use items approved by the car seat manufacturer to be sure they have been tested for crashes i bought this for my stroller to prevent my newborn s head from bouncing around and to give her a bit of a nest the stroller bed looked so vast around her tiny body works great soft easy to install and remove it helps keep baby warm too 
5 5 love this hippo water flows out perfectly from harry s mouth he keeps a soft cushion on the faucet in case a head gets too close during bath time 
5 5 i picked up a gift set of these bottles today at kmart for 19 99 i know it s cheaper on amazon it i was desperate for new bottles today and couldn t wait any longer everyone giving these bottles 1 star and saying it leaks are not sealing it properly i m sure these bottles do not leak if yours is leaking then it s a human error so tighten the bottom a little more and you ll be good to go i m in love with these bottles and so is my son it does everything it says it s supposed to do on the packaging 
1 2 my toddlers can open the lid which defeats the purpose of the special bowl i am very disappointed because i thought they would be a better investment than they were waste of money the old design was much better the twist and lock 
4 4 a little rough
5 5 i was a little hesitant on ordering after reading that others didn t receive authentic medela adaptors ordered it anyway real medela part works great happy with replacement 
5 5 the spout allows you to put pre measured preferred formula into even skinny bottles with no mess 
5 5 the product is good
4 3 i bought this to place on our kitchen breakfast bar area where we have a hook on chair for our son we had a few other suction cup toys already but i wanted to get a few more for variety the idea being that he likes to bat and pull at those toys while we prepare his food or do other chores in the kitchen well he was able to snap the bee away from the suction cup base in half a second and of course 10 seconds later had dropped it to the floor too the toy is designed to do that come apart from the base but i didn t think it would be that easy so now it s just another toy we give him to play with but not while he s eating or sitting in his chair 
4 4 so far very pleased baby isn t here yet the assembly was fairly simple the hardware was all clearly marked which helped a ton there were no imperfections in the wood paint job that i could tell feels sturdy product as described i m not looking forward to lowering the mattress in the future though not going to be a very simple process of course i ve never owned any other crib before so i don t know how it compares to others overall very pleased and the price was good too 
5 1 my 9 month old picked it up the very first time and hit himself in the corner of his eye with the top edge that caused a little blood and a lot of tears :(
5 2 baby always drop it the biggest problem is rubber bitten a little faster
5 5 love these locks they work great 
5 5 can t wait to give this cute bib booties set
5 5 this is my second set of bumkin bibs i love how they are easy to use and wash you can toss them into the washer and get them extra clean i ve accidentally thrown them in the dryer before and they re fine 
5 5 love love these changing pads they are perfect sized and soooo easy to wash lightweight and you can take them anywhere with you 
5 5 i love blueberry simplex diapers this one is so adorable 
5 5 easy to hold can be use with hot or cold beverages quality is pretty good thicker than our other stainless steel cups and prettier too highly recommended 
5 5 love this product
1 1 you get what you pay for this barely stayed on my toddler 
5 5 my teething daughter loves these 
5 5 i received this pillow right on time for my baby girl we were recently told by her doctor to have her propped up a little to help with her reflux but at the same time she has allergies so the pillows we have will not work for her so when i got the chance to purchase this pillow during a promotion i was thrilled as i was in the market for a soft cozy yet not make her allergies flare up we used this pillow last night after removing the tags and throwing it in the dryer for a little bit the tags were easily removed and didn t cause any rips or other damages my daughter loves her pillow and held on to it since i hand it to her she keeps squeezing it to watch it puff right back up my baby slept like a baby with this slumberlux pillow or should i say she slept like a husband this will clean easily as the material on the outside you can just wipe it off liquids will not be able to penetrate either which is a big plus with kids i was able to buy this pillow at a promotional rate and all views and opinions expressed here are 100 of my own 
5 4 my toddler loves this pillow and has been sleeping better at night and for her nap since we got it there are two minor issues though the pillowcase is 50 polyester and makes her sweaty and the open style of the case makes it very easy for her to take off so not perfect but pretty good for the price 
5 4 love these bright colors the headband was a nice fit when my daughter was a newborn 
5 5 this bed is amazing my daughter is 20 months old and we do a lot of traveling it fits perfect in hotel rooms it is a little bulky but worth carrying around she loves it so much she pulls it out at nap time at home very happy with our purchase 
5 3 i love a a products but i was really sad to see how small these bibs got after just one washing i think i will stick with the burpy bibs 
1 1 handles ripped the first time i tried to transfer laundry to my laundry basket obviously it cannot be used to carry laundry my daughter did this and the handle completely ripped off as she walked down the stairs 
5 5 bowls arrived on time and as pictured
4 4 i really like these cups the spout is not super hard but hard enough that they aren t easily chewed through they don t leak thanks to the nuk valve that is interchangeable with others in this line the only problem i had is the picture is red and blue but my son got a pink and purple cup 
5 1 i m sitting in my hotel right now exhausted from carrying my infant i his sling all day because he refuses to get into this uppababy stroller i purchased this stroller specifically for this trip to canada i wanted something lightweight to bring with us on the plane and this stroller won over the maclaren triumph only because it has a larger canopy i don t know if umbrella strollers just don t have suspension or shock absorption but my 8 mo old refuses to get into this stroller and cries every time i strap him in the wheels are smooth plastic that look and feel cheap now on day 4 of our trip i am very weary of even going out and exploring the city since my only other option is to put him in the sling the good features this stroller has are large canopymesh backinglightweightease of folding and unfoldingthis worthless stroller pretty much put a damper on our trip going forward we ll be bringing our awesome stokke scoot even though it s inconvenient 
5 5 these were delivered in a timely fashion and in good condition they have served my needs well i use them to put in places where i normally get rashes especially in hot weather because i have areas where skin touches skin these absorb the moisture caused by this and the antibacterial properties probably help too result no more rashes 
5 5 carters is a quality brand bought these as a shower gift with a newborn one can never have enough lap pads 
4 4 was the best sippy cup we had until my 2 year old dropped it probably for the millionth time and it cracked we had it for 8ish months i won t buy another one only because my daughter can now drink from a cup and a regular water bottle this was a great 34 water bottle 34 to keep in the diaper bag because it never leaked i also liked how it was clear and you could see how much liquid was left would be 5 stars but took away a star because it broke when dropped 
1 3 the leg holes were so tight on our baby s thighs that even if i could stuff him into this chair it was extremely difficult to get him out 
5 5 these were fantastic valences put i would of had to change rods and more holes in walls lol so i had to send back but they are prompt and exactly what they say they are thanks
1 1 horrible that these are even being sold it should be listed as a toy hammock for a dollhouse that s the size of it 
5 5 works great for my tall 3 5 year old and my smaller 5 month old ;)
5 5 great
5 4 love that this set fits a todder bed adds brightness to a darker room when washed the comforter and sheets come out really wrinkly but that doesn t really bother me really like the fitted top sheet because it stays in place really well 
5 4 sheets fit great on our pac n play 
5 5 my wife loves this i mean absolutely loves this so she s happy which means i m happy 
5 5 fits on my bob and works as expected 
5 5 its adorable the boats on the base are so so cute 
5 5 we purchased this product for our finicky newborn as a hail mary nothing was helping him or us get any sleep i initially had no intention of using the vibrating feature as other vibrating contraptions didn t last long enoughenough or shut off abruptly and woke up our sleeping baby but in this rocker it is just an on off switch this thing has been going on the first battery install for a month and a half and still going it vibrates overover night we ve even forgot to turn it off in between naps etc the first night we put him in it was one if the best sleeps we ve had it didn t solve all our problems but alleviated them we have since learned that our little man has acid reflux and the angle if this rocker was just the thing so in summary 1 love the angle for acid reflux2 love the continuous vibrator3 it s not a battery guzzler4 love that we now are getting sleep 
5 5 great product
5 5 i have tried many many breast milk storage bags and by far i like honeysuckle bags the best the quality of the bags are great thicker plastic double seal top that has never failed me yet and easy to write on surface the shape of the bags are perfect for easy pouring and great for freezing flat and stacking i had trouble with the other bags not having a wide enough opening to pour the milk into having a weird shape which made freezing them flat not really beneficial since i got rounded frozen popcicles that keeps toppling over when stacked and flimsy plastic side seals that made worried about them tearing so far i have not had any leakage or breakage issues with any of the brands i have tried and i m lucky in that aspect i ve heard and read about many people who have experienced leaking bags which is frustrating since it s very tough on our bodies to make 34 liquid gold 34 i purchased these 50 bags to try along with all the other brands and loved these best and it was the best price per bag as well i was sad to find out they weren t selling through amazon due to some issue but i was able to buy it directly from the company in bulk of 600 bags different design but still great quality and i m extremely satisfied over 800 ounces of 34 liquid gold 34 bagged so far _ 
5 4 good crib
5 5 i love these bags i steam everything once a week the bags make cleaning easy and quick 
5 5 good buy for my baby 
1 2 i purchased this because the description said it was cotton the tag on it says 100 polyester it also has strings coming out of the top of its head disappointed 
5 3 as expected
1 1 i didn t actually this this it s flimsy thin and does not appear to waterproof 
5 5 we needed another one and this fit the need who know why but it has become the new favorite 
5 4 love this my 4 month old loves to chew on the stuffed animal 
5 5 the only ones my son will use 
5 5 my little one loved this pacifier it is like a soothie which she loves but does not hit her in the nose and you can easily put a pacifier holder on it 
5 5 we have several of these the baby loves them 
5 4 initially my baby did not like this and i didn t either i gave it to her when she was either 3 months or 4 months i can t remember which and she would drop it every few seconds she couldn t seem to keep it in her mouth then she d cry so every few seconds i d have to turn around and give it back to her consequently i packed it away for awhile she normally uses a different pacifier brand so i wonder if the style of pacifier just took some getting used to i tried it again around 5 months and now she s doing well with it and likes it she can hold onto it now and can keep it in her mouth she seems to really like playing with it so if you buy this and your baby doesn t like it i recommend trying it again in a month or two i think mine was just too young initially or something 
5 5 i never thought i would purchase this but it s been a ilfesaver now i always have an extra pacifier on hand and i don t have to dig through my huge diaper bag to find an extra comes in handy when baby is screaming and her pacifier is nowhere to be found it s not absolutely necessary but it has made life easier more than once it also matches my diaper bag perfectly 
5 4 so cute loved it 
5 2 it was a great replacement for the gerber 6 12 months that is not being sold at any stores or online after 3 weeks it became sticky and we had to trash it for the price we expected it to last longer also when its dropped it blends with the hardwood rolls around and lands under a piece of furniture 6 or 7 feet away not so great if the baby is crying and you have to crawl around looking for it 
5 5 mam is the only brand my kids would happily take 
5 5 the only pacifiers my son will use no idea why they are so hard to get they really are great for breast fed babies no nipple confusion
5 5 no more smelly itchy backside
5 5 it s a stache it even comes with a custom cover baby likes it mom and i dig it 
4 4 i like it and thought it would be nice to keep my granddaughter s pacifiers clean but my daughter in law doesn t use it i would be worried attaching it to a diaper bag because it seems like it could get knocked off too easily 
5 3 this was the perfect size for my friend s robyn s baby she is going on three months old but was a tiny preemie like a dog sniffing a bone baby annaleigh played with it a while before suckling the passie the pacifier is contoured for great sucking support the pack has two pacifier in it for 6 bucks which is a pretty good price but i do not like the 9 in shipping i don t know what bpa free and is dishwasher safe 
5 5 these are the only pacifier my breastfed son would take we literally tried them all i love how it s nipple shaped to resemble mom 
5 5 so cute 
5 2 tried 3 different pacifiers although these were good quality and received what was ordered my baby doesn t like these the best so far is nuk
5 5 tried avent soothies and baby didn t care for them at all than mam baby liked much better than tried nuk and these were her favorite
5 5 my baby accepted them from the first moment 
5 5 my grand daughter love this but i do have some concern about cleaning it but i really like this idea
5 5 so cute 
5 5 great product 
5 5 necessity for new baby care this thing is awesome 
5 5 kids love this especially the remote control 
3 3 looks dirty binky doesn t come off to be cleaned 
5 5 i have a 5 year old grand daughter and black leather seats which always had marks from her shoes no more plus there is a place for her stuff i love them and so does my grand daughter thank you 
5 5 my husband and i have found this product to be very helpful and have recommended it to others the concept is a little strange the first time you go to use it but you quickly get used to it it also does not upset our newborn daughter as much as an aspirator would 
5 5 my new go to baby gift i bought my daughter the hippo and she loved it so much i bought this sweet lamb for my niece the stuffed animal is so soft and the book is adorable i also bought the spotted dog for a cousins baby love these sets
4 4 it s lightweight pretty easy to unfold and fold the stroller part and pretty easy to click and unclick the car seat and switch it between the stroller and the car base the springs are too stiff to be effective shock absorbers and the stroller is meant for hard or paved surfaces only the wheels just aren t up to grass sand or soil the straps are not one strap adjustable the straps have to be fiddled with to get a good snug fit there s no quick release on the base taking the mounting base in and out of a car requires a bit more time than if it had a quick release the solution is to buy extra bases for other family cars baby is about to outgrow it at one year all that said the positives outweigh the negatives we d rate it on the higher end of budget models for more features such as quick release base and simplified strap adjust look for higher end models 
5 5 my grandson loves this book one of his favorites at the moment
5 5 these washcloths are soft the colors are lovely it came with a little cute box love it
5 3 price a little hight for product
5 5 love this color runparooz and thirsties are my fave covers and they do not fail i love that the newborn is adjustable and fits up to 15 lbs i think m
5 3 i have boys and of course i received girl colors but delivery was superb 
5 5 exactly what i needed fast delivery thank you 
5 5 i have the grey and sangria wraps i love both but the grey is a bit more versatile at first i had a lot of difficulty wrapping when my baby was a newborn but after about a week i got the hang of it after watching some good youtube videos and love it it s so simple and adjusts as your baby grows 
5 4 my kids love it and it encourages to wash hands i used it with a baby body wash and works great then i used it with hand soap and it takes a few tries before something comes out maybe its too thick its bigger a than i thought so i loved it even more 
5 5 the pictures do not do these justice they are adorable 
5 5 i love them 
5 5 easy to use
5 5 this is a great way to get that dose of vitamin d in the kids it doesn t have a noticeable flavor so i just put it in their juice or milk in the morning i love that the bottle and dropper are glass and there are no dyes or additives in the product 
5 5 bought this for my daughter s family they are expecting their second child she loves it 
5 5 works well push down on it when placing it on the seat for suction and it hold great easy to clean very happy with my purchase
3 2 the mesh bag itself is great for holding bath toys however the suction cups won t stick to anything i ve tried several different surfaces and can not get them to stick 
5 5 my 1 3yrs old son is obsessed with cars and a fussy eater this speed up eating and keep him on the table for long enough to finish his meal the quality is excellent worth the prince 
5 1 i liked the product while it lasted despite gentle use and painstakingly counting my wipes before filling the pouch one of the two cases i received split by end of the zipper after approximately one month of use the concept is great but quality is obviously an issue 
1 2 this product is great in theory and it was while it worked the problem is it only worked for four months it is now past the return period and i m stuck with it the projector started working intermittently after only a couple of months and now the sound shuts off without warning while on the continuous mode waking up the baby 
4 4 they do change color turn white but it seems like it takes a temperature that would be extremely too hot for a baby they should be a bit more sensitive these are probably my least favorite spoons but they get the job done so i will keep them happily :)
5 5 my pediatrician recommended bandanas for my teething son and these don t disappoint i love the designs 
5 5 these really work at around 7 months our daughter had started sleeping through the night really well except that meant she would pee through her diaper every night and sometimes wake up wet sometimes sleep through wet clothes so i got these and now she sleeps through the night without leaking she hates being wet so she sometimes still wakes for us to change it but it doesn t get out of the diaper and she goes right back down after we put on another one of these besides these we only use the 34 natural 34 brands of diapers but it was so worth it to get these 
5 5 this was the best purchase for the money 58 and it is sturdy colorful spacious easy to clean bright and very cheery my great grandson mackson enjoys it thoroughly when visiting great grammy don t hesitate if you are thinking of buying a playard 36 34 x36 34 lots of room to play in 
5 5 my son is a pretty active sleeper and we were having trouble with him kicking out of his blankets getting cold and waking us up these pajamas particularly the long sleeved ones solved that issue my son sleeps comfortably and i don t have to get up as often in the night as he is still warm even if he kicks out of his blankets 
5 5 we purchased this monitor after having tried a mobicam monitor which we returned after learning that the camera could not be moved to view our son we have been incredibly pleased with this monitor and use it all the time to check on our son we even take it with us when we travel the setup is easy and convenient and several of our friends have purchased the monitor after seeing how nice ours is 
5 5 adorable
5 5 the package was in perfect condition did not look squished or anything like it sometimes can get in transit when i took my dream out of the package it was very soft and perfect no snags or pulls i was nervous to wash it because i didn t want to ruin it but i washed it on hand wash on cold and dried on delicate my daughter took to it right away she loves her swaddles i can t wait to buy more 
4 4 these work but the velcro can get caught in hair my daughter isn t a fan of wearing them but she likes playing with them in the tub 
5 2 ghosting when movement goes across screenthis has delayed video footage compared to summer infant dual view this wasn t 34 real time 34 definitely delayed very weird since it was more expensive and its a motorola we actually got a system too and this was the extra and the camera that came with system didn t work out of the box screen showed purple hue and green on parent unit after that we decided no way we bought an updated summer infant monitor like the original summer infant one we had 5 years ago now we have two summer infant systems and both work great no delay and great image try them out side by side and i guarantee you will not purchase this video monitor good luck here is what we kept tried 5 monitor systems and bought another summer infant http www amazon com summer infant digital color monitor dp b00eu5al8w
5 5 these are so soft and a great size we use them constantly 
5 5 works as expected 
5 1 my baby didn t like it she never sleep on it comfortably it s flimsy and small i don t think any baby can sleep in it more than a month or so 
5 5 babies love this toy it crinkles and has all different textures on all 5 corners definitely a must have 
4 4 so far so good the only complaint i would have is the night image is bright in the center of image but not at the edges it makes it hard to decipher what is in the image near the edges my previous lorex camera had better night vision or at least the image was more uniform at night 
4 4 seems to be a good pillow haven t had it for very long yet therefore haven t had to wash it yet to see how it holds up it s not as soft as it claims to be the fabric is a little papery feeling 
4 2 love bumpkins baby bibs but the junior bibs are a bit odd very large bib but oddly small and non adjustable non elastic arm holes making this annoying and difficult to put on a wriggly toddler 
5 5 i bought this to replace my old diaper bag i was looking for something more roomy and organized this bag is perfect it is so easy to find what you are looking for and the messenger bag style is helpful when trying to carry baby my only complaint is that the wipes get stuck sometimes when i m trying to pull them out but they are still moist 
5 5 this gate was very useful in preventing our child from entering the kitchen and to keep him contained in the child proof living room where he can play with his toys and run around i really like how it is easy to adjust and it fits firmly at the entrance to the kitchen later we will move it to the baby s room and i believe it will be easy to adjust the gate to the door width which is really convenient :)
1 1 it is a low quality so i return it later i go to babierus to purchase this item it is very good
5 5 i love it 
5 5 i love this product as my two older boys used it when they were babies now having the 3rd son i needed for my son its soothing pacifier and i love it how it doesn t hurt the baby s mouth 
5 5 we love wubbanubs and this one is cute unique i like to have several because i wash them in batches on the gentle cycle in a lingere bag with dreft that keeps them from getting too funky my one year old is obsessed with these 34 doos 34 because they are easy for her to find and manipulate way more affordable on amazon than at a specialty baby store thanks amazon you re my huckleberry 
5 3 i ordered these specifically because i thought it was a 3 pack i only got a 2 pack 
1 2 not worth it if they get direct sunlight for awhile during the day they glow brightly but not for long by the time my daughter has her night wake up 3 4 hours after we close the blinds they re not glowing at all so by the time i need them they re done will not waste my money on these next time and will stick with the regular mam pacis 
5 5 this is a really great color and was fairly east to put up does it s job keeping my 8 month old from sticking his feet through the slats on his crib and getting them stuck stays up pretty well even with my son trying to climb it when he wakes up from his nap just needs a little tug to get it back into place 
3 5 ok
5 4 simple to install and provide a cover for three prong outlets in the house the installation of about 6 of them took less than 15 minutes and appear to operate easily we can easily slide the prongs open with a plug to access the outlet we haven t yet seen how our child interacts with them but initially they look very promising i would recommend this for anyone that is not up to replacing the actual outlet with a tamper resistant outlet 
5 4 great for bath time
5 5 my favorite brand of cloth diapers and we tried a lot of brands 
5 5 our son is 19 months and still sleeping in a sleepsack this one works great and it keeps him from climbing out of his crib 
5 5 excellent product and universal to fit any application the fabric is durable and pliable i was exhausted of trying to find a car seat protector that was not rigid and plagued with glue seat marking problems when i found this one it solved all my problems and i was super excited and when i installed it i was even happier 
5 5 nice for our grandson nice thick and very vibrant colors he loved it 
5 2 so this stroller is beautiful i love the look of it i love that it has a bassinet and that that and the car seat can go in and out of the stroller base i have had this for just over a year and i bought it because the car seat went down to 4lbs i was really impressed with the look and the price was good i thought it is way over priced for the quality it isn t like i use it to do anything crazy i have mostly just walked on sidewalks the few times i have gone 34 off roading 34 grass it doesn t turn well and it gets stuck easily it is extremely wobbly and i feel like it will fall apart at any moment i dont like having my one year old in it cause it feels really unsafe i have two other kids and they like to grab the handle and pull on it it has almost fallen so many times and it is scary and frustrating i really like the look of it but all the bad out weigh the good i am going to try and get rid of this as soon as i can 
5 5 adorable for the price very cute and soft my son loved it 
5 5 looks exactly the same 
5 5 bassinet is solid easy to set up and take apart 
5 5 my daughter loved it i put it in the easter basket for the upcoming baby 
5 5 perfect a bit big if you have a small car so order with caution 
1 1 bad
5 4 very soft good quality very difficult to get on a zipper or something would be a great options for these 
5 4 no incidents to truly test it out yet but its an excellent crumb catcher only issue is it moves around easily and you have to put it back in its place often
5 5 gorgeous and simple perfect for a little baby girl i ve given one to both of my god daughters at their baptisms hoping to start a family tradition i ll be ordering a blue one in a few months for our next addition and his too will be brought to church to be blessed alongside our family during his baptismal ceremony a little extra info on the product itself since i ve had 2 now for those like me who d like as much info as possible when ordering online the little porcelain case each rosary sits in is slightly different each time and does not close tightly it is meant to just sit on top so it will not 34 secure 34 the rosary the pieces will come in a small box perfect for wrapping or putting into a tiny bag gift idea i usually add a crib ornament with this and it s a complete gift for any newborns baptism the inside is wrapped in small bubble wrap so it is packaged and shipped very nicely there is a little pink pillow blue for boy and then the little rosary it is literally sent to you ready to be wrapped up or hand delivered as is i hope this helps th trees really nothing else to mention about this product feel free to ask 
5 5 works great i always buy these i am a dog sitter so i use mine quite a lot i watch pretty big dogs so after a while they obviously wear out but i keep buying them because before they wear out they work great you don t have to put any holes in your walls you can put it between walls or a doorway or whatever it stays tight so dogs can t get through it s also a nice height 
5 5 my little ones favorite book some of the word associations are abstract but he live it because it has mickey mouse it is helping him recognize letters
5 5 great product for child or dog 
5 5 i bought this for my precious granddaughter she presently has a heavy winter blanket and since spring and summer are around the corner i thought this would be perfect for her i haven t been to visit yet her family lives eight hours away from me this lovie is very nice quality very soft and well made i will update after i see her in june i hope she loves it :(
5 1 these were way to small
4 4 this carrier was very comfortable i love how easily it comes apart i also love the burp cloth that attaches to the front of it it was helpful because my baby spit up a bit but the burp cloth saved my shirt from getting soiled the one thing that i wish is that it came with a set of directions on which straps attach to what it was a bit confusing upon taking it out of the box but once i spent some time figuring it out it as easier to put together i wore my baby for about 2 5 hours while trailing after my 3 year old it was nice to be arms free 
5 5 perfect for newborn pictures very soft as pictured 
5 5 very cute fits my 5 month old
5 5 we bought this to protect our leather from the indentations of the car seat it does seem disperse the weight well and when removing compression marks fade withing the hour 
5 5 this product is awesome work like a charm and every parent should own one 
5 5 good thick sturdy fabric i use this wet bag for weekend trips with one babe fits about 15 diapers and maintains its shape standing up i would recommend kanga care wet bags and their rumparooz diaper covers 
5 5 works perfectly love the color 
5 5 pairs perfectly with the wonder mat to create the perfect play space for your little b ones 
5 5 awesome bag the way it s made the print the pockets the two zip pockets very roomy inside magnetic closures are very strong very pleased with that it s a great looking bag i m using it this week to take on my trip to the uk as my purse it just doesn t have to be a diaper bag it can be your momma bag it looks that stylishlovin it 
5 5 perfect toddler size pillow i love the natural filler and cover of this pillow and appreciate the chemical free design as well i love how it can be washed and will not bunch up i highly recommend this toddler pillow 
5 5 love love love have i mentioned that i love this product my lo absolutely adores these pacifiers it is so cute and very soft easy for little fingers to hold on to making it less likely to fly on the floor highly recommend must have product 
1 2 it looks poor quality
5 5 product of exelente quality product
5 5 these seem to be the best size and shape preference for my little girl every other pacifier we tried she would dismiss i recommend the glow in the dark ones for bedtime lifesaver 
5 4 seriously it s the only paci my baby takes 
5 5 worked like a charm just what he needed 
5 5 texas babies love the browns too 
5 5 philips avent pacifier is designed with a lighter and smaller shield for newborns 0 2 months and the collapsible nipples recognize the development of the baby s palate gums and teeth if any the holes in the curved shield create more air flow to reduce skin irritation and the pacifier comes with a snap on cap for good hygiene the nipple is made strong so it won lose its shape after being used for a while it is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized because it is the right size for newborns it will remain in the baby s mouth and not slip out or be spit out making it more sanitary the avent comes in a hand two pack very nice product well designed and made with safe ingredients 
5 5 i love this product as my two older boys used it when they were babies now having the 3rd son i needed for my son its soothing pacifier and i love it how it doesn t hurt the baby s mouth 
5 4 it is so nice to have easy access to a paci when you needs one 
3 4 nice but we did not made use of it as much as i hoped my baby was not that in to it 
5 5 i use these gates to block off the upstairs from the downstairs to keep my dogs seperated one gate goes at the base of the stairs and the other at the top so far i havent had any issues with the dogs knocking them over i have one 80 lbs pitbull another 50 lbs pit mix and a 12 lbs jack russel the only down side to these gates is that there is no door to bypass the gate through so any time you would like to get past the gate you either have to manuever over it or un do the latch i dont mind this though because i think that a gate with an accessible door would be less sturdy we marked our latch spot with a permanent marker for quicker set up 
4 4 actually is a really good product i am satisfied with the color size the fabric but i was waiting to see at the back side the diaper changing but it was no there so for me is the only one that is missing
5 2 unlike others i don t have a problem with the outlet covers they fit very snug in our outlets my problem is the cabinet drawer locks you cannot get these in drawers and if you putt with any force they come right open my 2 year old can easily get into the cabinets we put them on so only 2 3 of these products worked for me buy at your own risk 
5 5 she loves it 
5 5 this is the best footmuff bunting we have tried for our children it has been warm enough during 20 f weather kids in coats and hats as well but has also been great in mild 50 60 f weather it blocks the wind and sheds water and it zips up each side so that the child s torso can also be protected we also love the small zipper pocket on the bottom for storing mittens or pacifier or tissues etc this is super easy to wash as well 
5 5 my son absolutely loves this it not only arrived on time but was a great price too 
1 1 i was excited to get this monitor because of all the great reviews it has i am highly disappointed with this after using it for 6 months i will be one room away from the nursery and the 34 out of signal coverage 34 error will come on and everytime that happens the unit makes a loud beep noise not just any beep a very loud one when you have a sleeping baby you don t really want something beeping loud every ten seconds and almost waking him up i m sure it s saying out of signal coverage because of the interference with our wi fi but we shouldn t have to worry about that if i m laying in bed and playing on my phone it makes the loud beep noise because my phone will be using wifi and the monitor doesn t like any other object in your house to be using wifi we will try to watch a movie on netflix or amazon fire but once again it just sits there and beeps bc of the wifi interference so then i end up having to turn off the monitor because i don t want to sit there listening to it beep loudly every ten seconds while watching a movie do not recommend this monitor which sucks because the picture quality really is goos 
5 5 she loves this still 
3 3 like the bags but the dispenser was not great you really had to pull excessively to get the product out i eventually just threw the dispensers away and use the bags on their own 
5 4 the cream is excellent but for the amount brings it too expensive 
5 5 i love this bib it s light weight and products the baby s clothing
5 5 great quality sheets at a bargain price fast shipping good packaging trusted seller will buy again 
2 3 great idea sticks on well but my 10 month old ds broke it in 2 days 
5 2 i ve had this toy for two of my kids when they were infants neither of them seemed to find the toy much fun it s one of those toys that they play with for 2 or 3 minutes before they get bored i thought it was a fluke with the first kid but my second also doesn t seem interested in this toy that much luckily it s pretty cheap to purchase 
5 5 excellent mattress and quick delivery mattress is the perfect size for a mini crib and would suggest to anyone 
5 5 my 2 year old loves her pillow she gets excited every night to lay on 34 my pillow and get tuck tucked in 34 perfect size and great quality thanks for a great product 
2 3 not girl cups as pictured i know it said design my vary but i assumed it would be one of the two pictured instead i got two race car cups 
5 5 great product
1 1 i have had this highchair for a few months and wish i did more research before buying the cover does not come off so you can t wash it and wiping it down is not enough also you need 2 hands to put the tray on the tray usually doesn t allign right and takes some time to get it right i thought the highchair came with a 5 point harness but does not my baby slides and falls to the side while eating this causes her discomfort since her arm gets all red from being pinned to the side or stuck hanging over the chair wishing i bought another highchair 
4 3 sits very straight up but otherwise comfortable and easy to assemble 
5 5 love it so easy to install 
5 5 i love this product they are very absorbent and they don t hold stains 
5 4 love it 
5 5 such a pretty wet bag and it works very well 
5 5 shipped quickly good quality mattress 
5 4 all ok
1 1 we were so excited to get our new car seat we were disappointed because the shade was permanently bent it only pulls down partially also the buckle gets stuck sometimes i m going to call customer service to see if i can exchange our seat i felt like it was cheaply made 
4 5 instructions are a bit difficult but it s doable love the color and the crib 
5 5 great product
5 5 these work great no parts to take apart for and no leaking 
5 5 this product is truly the easiest children s product i have ever used it always sets up with no complications and works perfectly i love it because it is so simple and the children love it 
5 5 these are so adorable and exactly what i was hoping for 
5 5 awesome so easy and it looks great 
5 4 good
5 5 this has been great for our diaper bag it fits 2 avent pacifiers and keeps them clean i like that it is separate from other things in the bag 
1 1 we received a fake not retail packaged no fctry labeling on paci even the silicone part is slightly different than the other one we have 
5 5 excelente
5 5 super cute 
5 5 perfect gift 
5 5 same as used in the hospitals
5 5 these are perfectly small for newborns and so adorable i love the subtle design they are both lightweight very lightweight and have tiny little covers that allow you to keep the covered area hygienic the hard plastic case in which these are sold make these pacifiers fantastic shower gifts they are a set of two love these 
5 5 best pacifiers i bought thus far the can hold on to it at only 2 months old and she seems to only like these from all of the ones i purchased 
5 5  :)
4 5 my son loves it however i do think its over priced but over all its great
5 5 cute and perfect easily fits two pacifier
5 5 love them
5 5 i love it and loves it
5 5 my daughter has lost so many binkies especially at night got these thinking glow in the dark wonder how she will like them well they are perfect it s the only nipple she likes out of every brand and at night when she spits it out i can find it super easy instead of searching in te dark half asleep and waking her up more 
5 5 baby loves them 
5 5 my friend will get a kick out of this lol love it 
5 2 maybe because we first bought the puppy kitty wubbanub first but this bunny just isn t quite as nice the puppy kitty are both floppy with heavy beans in the feet perfect for staying in place on baby so the pacifier doesn t fall out this bunny is too stiff light the feet don t hug the baby and the pacifier is easily pushed out of the mouth or falls to either side not super impressed also it looks more like a sheep with long ears than a bunny 
5 3 what every child wants well made 
5 5 great item
5 5 these are so nice in the middle of the night when its dark and you cant find the paci 
5 1 this wubbanub works fine and for baby looks great you can t tell by the picture but the face of the bear is completely flat it looks super odd from the side like someone punched the nose in the belly of the bear is in the same fabric as the feet which are ribbed this makes it look like a crocodile baby isn t going to care about any of this but adults should it s kind of ugly in person 
5 5 he is super cute his legs aren t quite as heavy as some of the wubbanubs to keep him in place but the shape of his legs kind of make up for that 
5 5 absolutely our favorite pacifiers have you seen the pacifiers that have rubber wraps to the handle yeah try cleaning those and they will become water logged which leads to mold these prevent that as it is all one piece basically they work with paci clips really well both the ones made for these by the same company and even generic or diy paci clips like on etsy actually i like the diy ones better as they loop around and cannot be yanked out by the babe if registering for these i would put at least 6 pairs on it cheap great add on item for guests to buy you and you really will need them all when you realize how easily they are lost 
5 5 so cute and perfect
5 1 what used to be my salvation nearly became my nightmare today my son 6 months put his soothie into his moth sideways he began to choke thank all the stars above i was there to get it out of his mouth i will be removing all of his soothies especially from his bed i would urge any parent to use this with caution 
5 5 if you re baby will take a mam pacifier these are a must have it makes it super easy to find and replace the pacifier without turning any lights on when the baby spits it half way across the room in the middle of night attach a 34 blanket 34 or a stuff animal to anchor it you re golden 
5 5 my son loves this pacifier i like because it is easy to clean some other pacifier are very hard to clean or impossible to clean when
5 5 my baby s theme is giraffe and i am sooo in love with this i want to buy more just because they are so cute and tiny for little babies 
5 5 not only are these adorable they are really great quality it is soft and comfortable my nephew loved it 
5 4 good
5 1 too big and bulky which makes it cumbersome
1 5 picture doesn t do it justice
5 5 bought it for my godson the family love it had some great laughs and pictures 
5 5 really nice basket gift very good value for money gave it in a baby shower and was very pleased 
5 5 different than the one piece avent soothie newborn pacifiers this pair of two new little pacifiers resemble more grown up models but they are just the right size for a newborn it was a pleasant surprise to see the included clear covers which i hope we don t misplace i have been very happy with the avent pacifiers for their design and durability and was happy to see this new entry inot the collection they are priced right and we always have extras on standby knowing how important they are for baby and all other concerned family members when baby needs it 
5 5 i have been using this model since i got it at the hospital i just love it
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my daugter will take the glow in the dark kind is very convenient they start to wear out a little after about 2 months but they are definitely worth it and we will continue to buy 
4 4 these are great very easy to find in the middle of the the nigh i would have given a five star but you cannot remove the animal from the pacifier to wash them 
4 4 the product is good but my son doesn t like it very much 
5 1 too big and bulky which makes it cumbersome
5 5 very cute
5 1 this thing smells like an old pool float and looked moldy out of package 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers our son would use plus they were easy to find at night in the dark
5 4 i got one of these at the hospital they are a quality product made out of a sturdy material we got several other brands of pacifiers at our baby shower but this one seems to workout the best with our baby she s not a huge fan of pacifiers in general and only wants to take one when she is super fussy or crying while she s waiting to eat the soothies are big enough and bold enough in color to find in the middle of the night in the crib too which is an extra bonus they re also really easy to keep clean you can also stick your pinky finger in the little hole on the nipple part and that really seems to be something my daughter likes a lot with all that said the best part of all isn t advertised these pacifiers are translucent so when you put it in your baby s mouth you can see the sucking action 
5 5 they really glow even months after purchase we keep these in the crib to make night time passy searching a breeze 
4 4 turns out my son does not prefer the rounded tips instead likes the more flat bulb pacis my toddler loves though yes she still has a pacifier i tried out myself though and it is very comfortable feel imitates a real breast and nipple it is also very soft and doesn t feel plastic 
5 4 this toy is really cute and i wanted my baby to love it but she just looks at it like 34 what is this thing 34 and doesn t pull on the strings at all and she loves her pacifiers i think the idea is great and maybe she ll take more interest in it when she s a little older but for now i think i m enjoying it more than she is 
5 5 great toy for my grandson
5 5 these are awesome 
5 5 only ones my twins will take 
5 5 too cute 
5 5 best pacifiers ever 
5 3 baby doesn t like pacifiers so i cant really say much but i would say that though our baby isn t big on pacifiers he gave this one a second chance lol
5 1 it bothers the child
5 5 great paci my son absolutely loves it 
5 5 these are great for newborns the only kind my daughter would take until about two months 
5 5 absolutely the cutest gift i have seen in a long time i can t wait to give them as gifts 
1 1 i do not get completely miss article bpa free
4 5 i guess it s hard to review pacifiers as reviewers tend to focus on whether or not their child liked the pacifier when giving stars i give the mam pacifiers 5 stars unequivocally regardless of whether my baby liked them or not because they are well made with a child s oral health in mind my toddler has been using mam pacifiers since she was 3 months old we tried every pacifier on the market and she could not keep the pacis in her mouth at that age the mam worked from the start and we haven t looked back they tend to be more expensive per piece than other pacifiers but i guess price isn t an issue if your baby likes this paci 
5 5 100 
5 5 love
5 5 my baby loves these pacifiers but i love the glow in the dark ones charge quickly charge lasts a long time and makes the pacifier easy to find in crib or bassinet at night 
5 5 just had twin grandchildren and grandmothers have to keep things like this around not much i can say about pacifiers i considered trying one out but my wife vetoed the idea they do look like excellent quality and were delivered quite rapidly great that they come in multiple colors so grandmother can remember which infant uses which pacifier let s be honest here she ll still get them mixed up 
5 5 love it
3 5 these are the only pacifier my son will use he prefers the shape of these orthodontic nipples to the round ones i should note that the picture on the front of the pacifiers is starting to wear off after 2 years 
5 5 love the mam 
5 5 my son loves it it s easier for him to keep in his mouth since he has a cleft 
5 5 can t wait for my twins to use these haven t received them yet but i m sure i ll love them i ordered the monkey and giraffe absolutely luv them life savers my babies hug them and wrestle with them so cute definitely gonna order more 
5 5 they work quite well and come in colors for boys or girls
5 5 really cute novelty love it 
5 5 my son was born 5 weeks early and spent a little over 3 weeks in the nicu anf the nurse recommended getting him one of these it is awesome it s easier to find in the dark he can grab it my favorite part is you can turn it upside down and wedge it between the bassinet so it won t fall out of his mouth as easy or tuck it in his swaddle 
5 5 excelent
5 5 my baby loves this soother and it s great when he s fussy or in between feedings i got this kind because it was recommended to me by other moms and i was told it s the kind that they use at hospitals although i waited to use the soother until about 5 weeks because i was worried about interfering with breastfeeding it hasn t been an issue at all and it use it now multiple times a day and it sometimes even works to put my baby to sleep i d definitely recommend 
5 5 these binkys are smaller and don t leave marks on baby s face like the larger ones do 
5 5 i bought these pacifiers at a reduced price for my honest opinion i think these pacifiers are the cutest thing ever they have the same pacifier shape as a normal pacifier my son didn t like them because of the shape but when he had it in his mouth for a couple seconds i think it was the cutest thing i have ever seen 
5 5 got this pacifier today hoped my 4 month baby will take it but he wont tried different kinds of pacis they don t work for us like this paci for its shape and meterial very good quality
3 3 it s much more normal than i expected the plastic material is weak though 
5 5 my lo can not be with out this wubba i highly suggest this product to all moms 
1 2 i do like this caterpillar the fabrics chosen are pretty and have nice texture unfortunately it will get a two star rating due the poor workmanship it was washed before initial use as per the instructions cold wash and air dried but a few of the seams appear to be coming apart i m sure i could fix this on my own but i don t think i should have to i may return and replace with another but i would be sorely disappointed if the same problems exsist with the next one 
5 5 just what we needed
5 5 after trying 3 pacifier without any luck finally i found one that my baby like 
5 5 we absolutely love wubbanubs the elephant is no exception it s the perfect size for my little guys hands and he loves it as a lovey chew toy and binkie 
5 5 baby only likes mam
5 4 these are the only pacifiers my son will take and he loves them i wish that they had a ring so attaching a pacifier holder was easier you can get a clip on the little tab that sticks out but most store bought paci holders don t have clips on both ends 
5 5 great product got here fast
5 5 these pacifiers are great rated well by physicians they have not caused us any problems with nipple confusion our baby has been a sucker soother since day one so these help us in between feedings and help our baby to fall asleep they also have holes in the ring around the pacifier in case a larger child swallows it accidentally it will not block their airway this is a common occurrence in the er with young children made of good quality and have not worn with heavy daily use and hand washing 
5 5 baby loves this snuggles with kitty and can now put pacifier in and out of mouth without help 
4 3 the picture shown on the product details is very misleading the price is for one case only 
4 4 great price here on amazon compared to the store easy to wash my daughter used it but not a lot not sure if it was just her or if something about this pacifiers shape that she didnt like 
5 5 i love these wubbanubs hard to loose and easy to clean you don t have to put your fingers hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up let the little monkey s body handle that part they are nice and soft as pacifiers but also great for teething and not to mention a little 34 buddy 34 that has been there right from the very beginning of life we raised 4 kids and i don t know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight what a lifesaver you don t even have to clip it onto the baby s clothing those clips are nice but surely get lost in the laundry wish i had thought of this a long time ago for 5 months we began with 2 wubbanubs and remain with the same 2 my biggest problem is which one do you choose so precious highly recommend this product 
5 5 love these pacifiers 
5 5 really cute my daughter wouldn t use it because she was so attached to her caterpillar one but it is still a great product 
5 1 cheaply made materials my daughter 2 just got hers it cracked when she stepped on it and the second one got a hole in it from her just nibbling it she nibbles at her mam pacifiers all the time and has ten of those none of them have a single bit of damage from her nibbling in my opinion it s a bit pricey for not too good of a product 
5 5 love it and the concept of these pacifiers my grandson loves his dog so this was a cute idea for a pacifier 
5 1 falls off within a matter of minutes although it feels secure when i first attach to shower wall it looses suction quickly 
5 5 the wubbanubs are amazing they truly calm your child and give them something soft for comfort other than just a binky 
5 5 wow these are heaven on sore nipples i also just used to help clear a milk bleb and they worked great 
5 5 the wristbands were on time they will work fine 
4 3 if you are using for a diaper don t but if using for a burp cloth my favorite 
5 5 each of my kids has this hamper in their room it s the right size if you do laundy once a week it s easy to carry to the laundry room the perfect size and can be left out in the open 
4 4 the car seat is easy to install but the released button on the seat belt is very difficult to press i m not sure if they added this to be very tight of their recent recalls but it is a pain to unlock at times other than that it provides great head support and cushion 
5 5 excelente
5 5 medela products are great quality easy to clean and the medium flow is perfect for a little older baby i like that i never had to use another flow after the slow flow they really hold up well and i will be saving them for the next baby no cracks or tears
5 3 i believe one of the holes for my crib was missing so i had to drill one 
5 5 so soft and well made it looks just like the picture and it s actually bigger then the one he had before i will definitely be buying one for his sister 
3 3 super adorable but made out of cheap plastic the price is decent though it s just what you would expect could have a better suction cup my 2 year old flicks it and it falls but good for the price 
5 4 this is a great product that i am surprised hasn t existed for more time it is great that you don t have to put holes in the cabinets i have old counters that didn t seem to work with this product but the customer service was quick to help and provide suggestions 
5 5 i ordered this for my grandsons birthday and i had days to spare it made it on time the set is great because of the sippy cup i haven t found a set with all the needed pieces 
5 5 perfect fit loved it
5 5 great mattress protector it has washed well and seems to be really well made i will be buying again 
5 5 it was easy to follow instructions and put on the wall
5 5 wonderful purchase
5 5 my 16 month baby walks around the house for half an hour every morning and night 34 brushing his teeth 34 seems to feel good on his sore gums and he must like the taste of the tooth gel i will definitely buy again when it runs out 
5 5 love this brand
5 5 keep ordering these for 5 years now 
4 5 haven t personally used it myself but my granddaughter seems to like it 
5 5 what an excellent unit for the price clear picture in low light situations and you can easily switch between camera and talk to your baby through it if you want highly recommended 
5 5 this wrap has been a life saver i read the step by step instructions the first time i put it on and have not had to read them again it s pretty easy to put on and take off i have been using this since my baby was a week old i was the dishes and use it when he s fussy and needs to be close to his mama it comes with a little cloth storage bag but i just roll up the wrap and store it in our hall closet 
4 4 ok this doesn t fit me very well though i can make it work but it fits my husband pretty well it also isn t the most comfortable to wear however if you adjust it properly not the fastest thing to do it can be reasonably comfortable i love that it has a backpack we put a first aid kit and a few day hike emergency essentials in it and use it all the time if my 3 year old gets tired she can ride for a bit easily 
5 4 great for the plane trip comfortable for our four year old we felt very safe and he felt like a 34 big boy 34 sitting in the plane set between mommy and daddy only downfall all airlines are not enforcing the purchase of this harness so i faa shouldn t require it if they are not going to enforce it on everyone make this mandatory 
3 4 it was nice just the fabric was not what i expect
5 5 this looks amazing over the jaipuri quilt and shams very rich looking everyone says wow when they come into our daughter s room 
5 5 such a great idea for a new baby 
5 4 nice
5 5 great product and great price for add on purchase arrived qyickly too 
5 5 the baby loved this pacifier plus it was fun because he got a lot of double takes and laughs with it it was very unexpected to see a happy baby with a mustache 
5 5 my baby loves these she chews on the sides when teething also she didn t have any issue going to the new size i just wish i could know when ordering exactly what the colors would be instead of yellow mine came with green edges i don t mind though i also liked the fact that these are different than ones sold in the stores there were several babies born in our church this year and alot of them had the same newborn paci s 
5 5 this is a great baby calendar it has premade stickers to place on the calendar when appropriate this is a must have to keep track of your baby s accomplishments 
5 5 love it
5 5 i love this monitor my husband and i did a lot of research before finally deciding on this monitor it was exactly what we were looking for i was planning on having to spend a lot more on monitor but this one works great for the low price definitely will recommend it to my friends having kids 
5 5 it is nice that the main lid screws on 34 backwards 34 so you or little fingers don t unscrew the main lid when undoing the little orange one it is also nice that these are dishwasher safe in my house it needs to be dishwasher safe it would like to survive my 2 1 2 year old still uses them and i used it to put pizza sauce in when i made homemade pizza lunchables 
5 5 baby s favorite 
5 5 good design with the little cap easy to take when going out 
5 5 great buckle at the top elastic and buckle on the bottom 
5 1 way too tight for our 7lb newborn we couldn t even zip it very disappointing since he can escape from all of the other swaddles we ve tried 
5 4 this is the 4th sippy cup i got for my 11 month old and it finally worked it didn t take long for him to figure out how to use easy to use and his little hands can grab the handles very well my only concern is whether or not it is as easy to clean once i serve non water drinks to him though 
5 5 elegant and classy this is a very sturdy beautiful frame the god parents loved it 
5 5 very soft and cuddly our grandson loves it 
1 1 taste awful gags me and makes me want to throw up 
1 2 beware no latch attached only by the seatbelt for this price it is an issue will be sending this back 
1 1 not what i wanted
5 5 good quick sale the bottles that arrived didn t match the ones in the pic which i didn t expect but turned out happier anyway as i got the bottles i originally wanted 
5 5 love this lampshade for my girl s nursery goes perfectly with the lolli living owl base 
5 5 best purchase well worth the money my baby loves it
5 5 my two and a half year old son loves these they stick to the tub and wall tiles easily also the bag is very convenient for storage 
5 2 i bought this for dr brown bottles as well as medela pump bottles and parts let s just say i still have it and haven t actually used it the holes are too big for the membranes and yellow plugs on the pump parts and you can t really fit that many bottles in there either i think i wasted my money for trying to find something for pump parts but kept it for future things like sippy cups etc 
5 5 great fast shipping
5 5 very good
5 5 it is a good car seat and my son loves it 
5 5 very good
5 5 beautiful baby blanket so soft and would recommend it for any shower gift 
5 5 look very nice good product
5 5 i love this halo sleepsack my baby is 2 months old and we have used it frequently because he does not like to have his arms swaddled but stays warm in this fleece 
5 5 great job timely manner
5 5 absolutely gorgeous using now with my elderly father i bought one pack received it and promptly bought two more so soft just what is needed in a vulnerable time to clean in intimate areas and for bed bath perfect for face cloths as well i m going to get some and ideal for babies 
4 5 it s a big friggin hook for holding stuff on the stroller among other uses i will say however that it is overpriced harbor freight has some non branded ones for 1 99 but worth the cost of not having to drive to the store 
3 4 it s small but cute 
5 2 we had this seat and were using it for our daughter we go to the peditrician one day and she mentioned that she does not like the posture forming of our daughter we went through our daily routine and she said that babies are not meant to be sitting in positions that they are not ready for so basically you should not be propping your child up into a chair or seat that they are not ready to be in over time the bumbo seat can lead to a rounded back and a forward leaning head i also do not like the safety of the seat it only happened once but our daughter rocked the seat a little bit the seat was on the floor so there was no issue but this is not a babysitter by any means i think tummy time and other positions which are more natural are better for our kids 
3 3 doesn t really wash off takes some scrubbing but the idea is cool and enjoyable it also breaks pretty easily if the kid pushes out the color part 
5 5 we my daughter grandson and i love avent bottles and now theses cups we have tried others and they just don t make our baby as happy as avent he is mr independent and really likes to take care of things without help if he can i told my daughter that she has a two year old attitude in a one year baby since he was about four or five months old he has wanted to eat or drink what we had to eat or drink i have tried many different kinds of sippy cups expensive to cheap but nothing i tried worked until i found this one he wants what we have but he is just not ready to give up the nipple he really likes drinking out of these yes he can hold a bottle but with the handle these are different from a bottle and more like the cup that i have if we fill these with water what i drink or juice he really likes these he will now drink with the spout but there are times when he is tired that he still prefers the nipple we like that we have the option for our baby these saved many problems with a child that wants to be independent but is not quite capable of doing it all by himself yet 
5 5 i love this seat it takes up way less space than a highchair and is conveniently portable my 6 month old loves to be able to sit at the table with her big brother and sister it makes her feel like one of them it s easy to clean too i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a space saving seat that can be taken out and about 
5 5 perfect thanks
5 5 double as a foot rest for the full laid back kid lifestyle perfect for the toddlers that like to have their snack and bottle accessible during the stroll around town come on bob we have talked about that this should be included with a purchase of a bob stroller 
5 5 great toy
5 5 these maymom pump valves came quickly they are the same as the ones used for avent s original breast pump only better these seen to be made of a heavier more durable material i am hoping they will last longer 
5 2 arived early but pieces dont fit correctly
5 4 the granddaughter loved it
4 3 i m reluctant to even give it 3 stars if it would stay on the wall i would have given it 5 stars but the leaves are continually falling off the wall and other parts don t stick i wouldn t purchase again the set didn t come with much direction we cleaned the wall before applying not sure what else we could do to make it stick 
5 4 new model has a weird echo 
5 5 perfect 
4 3 i don t think they are detecting motion from 15 feet away maybe 5 to be realistic one of them doesn t seem to be 180 degrees as you need to walk right in front of it before it turns on they are definitely bright enough so you can see what you are doing and they don t turn on unless it is dark the quality is so so i you mount them on the wall with the stickers you won t be able to change the batteries 
5 5 excelent
5 5 bought this as an extra changing table to put in our bedroom for our newborn easy to put together works great it came with a flat changing pad but i bought one of the thicker curved ones instead i have no complaints about this changing table 
5 4 none available 
5 1 app freezes from time to time and we don t feel it is reliable for an all night monitor app is also difficult to get more than one devise or allow more than one user to view simultaneously good for monitoring for short periods of time would not recommend 
5 5 i never write a review but i live in a small house and needed more seating everyone that sits in this chair loves it it is so comfortable it arrived in one piece no assembly required it is a heavy chair due to the rocker swivel mechanism i bought the brown chair and when my 3 year old granddaughter eats snacks in it i just wipe it off with a damp cloth and so far so good the only thing missing is a comfy foot stool at a reasonable price 
5 5 easy to install and very sturdy my daughter did however figure it out quickly and ended up pinching her arm badly i the parts of the gate that slide together 
5 5 super quick to ship and this works great i love 4moms 
5 5 this thing is a savior with potty training kids i keep it in my car or 34 diaper 34 bag of i m carrying one whenever my 3 5 year olds need to go they don t have to touch the icky public toilet or have me attempt to hold them over the toilet we also take long car trips frequently having the potette makes it easy to stop anywhere once you run out of the bags it comes with you can just use grocery bags check them for holes first our final use for this was while camping instead of walking half a mile to the restroom facilities i could just set this up and put a bag in the legs on it are quite short it doesn t bother my kids because they are small for their age if you have a taller kid than mine it may get awkward but i d think it s better than trying to squat 
5 5 love this very durable and good material easy to put together my son loves it 
5 5 it is super easy to add on to my existing gate just a quick snap in now the original gathering strap is no longer functional due to the larger size but that is the only negative i can see the 2 extra panels makes a huge difference 
5 5 love it a lil small but worth it for me fast delivery n like how it has four lil silver things on the bottom so the bag will stand up instead of falling over has pockets inside as well as the outside
5 2 they don t block the smell as good as the expensive blue ones 
5 5 good
5 5 these are a perfect match for our rockets tula they are well made and a great size 
5 5 nice 
5 5 love it looks just as good in the babys room as on the picture
5 4 i love these stickers they are super cute the only thing is that the number isn t too well visible in photos because it s so thin otherwise super cute and dainty 
5 5 bought this for a christmas gift for my new grandson i hope he likes it will get back after he opens it
5 5 works great on my car windows so far i just stuck it on and then smoothed it out with a credit card i like that i don t have to worry about it being dangerous 
5 5 great product for the price
5 5 my son loves this it s a really good teething ring and easy for him to you the seller was a hundred percent accurate with description and fast with delivery
5 5 exactly what i was expected nice and big
5 5 all i can say had a message from calofornia saying my grandson loved it so thats good enough for me
5 2 i loved this for my baby in the beginning since it really helped the paci stay in her mouth when swaddled then one day i had her in the bouncy chair while i was getting ready and heard a gurgling noise she had one of the legs down her throat making her gag then threw up all over herself i was so thankful i was standing there and wondered how dangerous it could be for babies left unattended i m surprised there aren t more negative reviews about this product as i feel it s highly chokable 
5 5 great product
5 5 while my daughter only used this product for a month before she gave up on pacis all together this was a seriously beloved item in our home she was so cute with this in her mouth as she would learn to touch grab the giraffe she was about 5 7 months when she had this so it was very helpful in development in my opinion i am unsure of their sizing though it seemed as if it wasn t going to last very long with the nipple sizing and i couldn t find the next size up in the soothie so i was glad she just dropped the whole paci idea 
5 4 my sister is having a baby soon june 2015 and this is something very smart and i know she will find it to come in handy 
5 5 my house has a love hate relationship we these things my kid loves them and i hate them i really need to get rid of them cold turkey keeps the kid happy when he sleeps 
5 5 awesome gift super cute and babies love to teeth on the frog s feet it s a cute plush an awesome pacie and a teether it s 3 gifts in one 
5 5 we love these pacifiers and more importantly our little one loves these pacifiers they are the only ones he will not spit out i love the bright colors too as they are easy to find my only complaint would be that the colors vary so you can t pick which you want we have lucked out on colors each time between gender neutral and boy colors not that a pink pacifier is the end of the world 
5 5 great game super fast shipping i m very satisfied 
5 5 a good pacifier for my grandson he loves it
5 4 son liked it pretty well looks funny too prob not the 34 best 34 orthodontic one you can get but i mean you get this one for the 34 cool and fun 34 factor right 
1 1 this is extremely annoying that i had no option to choose girls or boys i needed in a rush and the few stores around me rarely stock up on the bigger size pacis of course i receieved girls i ripped package and really do not want to waste time returning wont be ordering again 
5 5 this pacifier is a life saver my daughter at 2 months old is on a medication that tastes horrible i would fight her ever time i had to give it and she would spit most of it out now that i have this awesome pacifier she takes every drop without any fussing or fighting i would recommend this to anyone with little ones truly is a life saver 
2 2 my babies are small so this product did not work for them although it might for an older baby for my 4 mos old girls it was but a bit large and cumbersome for sleeping they would grab it or rub it out of their mouths then cry and wake up :(
5 5 super cute 
5 5 my son loves this esp great for the car seat 
5 5 item was exactly as it appears and as described shipped quickly 
5 5 mam pacifiers are the only brand my daughter likes these are super cute the crystal plastic is a nice change and if course they are typical high quality mam pacies 
5 5 great product no complaints at all
5 5 what can we say it s a wubbanub it s literally the only thing that motivates my child to behave 
3 1 may be just my child but the cheap basic pacifiers seem to stay in his mouth better and he likes them more 
2 2 the snap that holds this on to whatever you attach it to is very weak the very first time i used it it went missing immediately found it lying in the driveway when we got home i guess it got bumped and fell off between the house and the car it s a great little pouch but unsnaps and falls off too easily 
5 5 my son uses it but it is a tad heavy for him at this time i am sure he will use it more as he gets bigger 
5 5 so cute i know he ll love it and it was well packaged it came on time for the baby shower 
5 3 my son loves the mam pacifiers and that is the only brand we buy he loves all the 0 6 month styles and he has all of them including the night time glow in the dark one but he refuses to use this air version for some reason and we can t figure out why 
5 5 great
5 5 my baby loves it
2 2 pros arrived quickly end of list cons got 2 with same quote why would i want 2 identical pacifiers also its a wide as my child s face it may be useable in a year but then ill still have a duplicate to hang out in the drawer unused maybe someday ill go to a baby shower for a giant 
5 5 prompt service and very happy with the quality
5 5 it is a great pacifier and perfectly priced 
5 4 so cute 
4 5 i like it because it cannot get lost as easily as a single pacifier however i thought it might be a little heavier so baby couldn t spit it out quite so easily all in all it is good my baby is only 2 5 months old so he isn t quite holding onto things and realizing what he s doing yet 
3 2 my baby didn t really like the pacifier but i like the ides of it being attached to a toy 
5 5 cute
5 5 wife loved it
5 5 great box for pacifier it keeps pacifier clean and easy to carry around 
4 1 kind of coolconcept but no way to sanitize soother as it doesn t detach overpriced overrated in my opinion 
5 5 my son loves these pacifiers 
5 5 i have tried several pacifiers and these by far are the best of the lot at least they re the only ones my baby want my son practically grew up to toddlerhood with these it got him through his circumcision his regular bouts of croup his vaccine ordeals and his frightening visits to the pediatrician s clinic when nothing else works these rubber lifesavers are the only answer to his explosive tantrums without these i would lose my sanity while treading the torturous path of parenthood 
4 4 my son loves it however he is using it too much it s starting to push his teeth 
1 5 it did not work lol
1 1 first one i received was wrong animal second one received was right animal but had a hole in the seam where the stuffing could come out decided to just get a refund i got tired of shipping them back 
5 5 my son love this pacifier it was great
5 5 great product 
5 4 i prefer these to the other pacifier wipes i like that they have xylitol in them 
5 5 i love wubbanub they have been my son s best friends and therefore mine 
5 5 this was a great gift to give for baby shower as it had everything a new mommy will need all the products included are useful and the quality is very nice and soft will help out in getting prepared for the bundle of joy my friend loved it 
5 5 bigger than i expected which was a pleasant surprise super cute i keep all 34 wet 34 items such as my baby butt cream and my hand lotion and chap stick in here basically anything i don t want to ruin my actual diaper bag if it were to open or leak it s adorable and made very well 
5 5 great product 
5 5 showed up early using as a replacement for kid very happy with product and seller 
5 4 it appears that the baby likes this pacifier
5 5 these are seriously the best invention for holding a soothie we used these with our last child and are now using these with our newest addition we rarely loose the binky they are nice and soft easy to clean we throw ours in the wash with all the other baby clothes and rinse the soothie part after to remove any film the detergentay have left for those parents who choose to give their child a pacifier this is a must have
5 5 my son loves these 
5 5 super cute gift bought it for a friend who just had a little baby girl comes in nice box adorable teddy bear elegant and classic for a present made of quality materials i highly recommend :)
5 5 my daughter likes these pacifiers i like that they are one piece and soft 
5 5 great at first my lil boy didn t pay much attention to it but now it s his favorite paci he holds the toy and hugs it to sleep so sweet the only issue is that i cannot sterilize it as other pacifiers i have to boil water and hold it some time in it but it worth it ;)
5 5 great deal
5 3 they are ok the first set i purchased my son loved but when i reordered another set these came different the part the child sucks on had too much air in it and my child was unable to suck on it had to return
5 4 i bought this to keep all my sons pacifiers together in my diaper bag and purse it serves that purpose exactly and fits about 3 pacifiers 
5 4 good tank
5 5 this is the best invention of the 21st century glow in the dark pacifiers no more looking everywhere in the crib for it at 2am i can see it from across the room such a smart idea 
5 5 great product 
5 5 perfect
5 5 buy as many as you can get these are genius keeps the soothie from rolling away or getting lost in the diaper bag also makes it a lot more fun for baby he quickly learned how to hold and retrieve his own soothie without having to use clips or anything love these so much 
5 5 great durable
5 4 the only pacifier my baby will take
3 3 not as cute as some it s just ok 
4 5 so cute a little bit difficult with the newborn to keep it in their mouth but with a little bit older baby it s perfect 
1 5 got pink instead of blue so returned but still a good quality pacifier 
5 5 my 13 month old son only uses binkies at nap time and night but has always needed two to fall asleep he likes one in his mouth and one in his hand mam is the only brand he will use and i love how cute these are the glow in the dark makes it easier for him to find if he moves around and loses track of the one in his hand 
5 5 works good for avent soothie pacifiers and nuks 
5 5 love this product we especially love using this while our baby is in the car seat because the weight of stuffed animal keeps the pacifier in place 
5 5 my baby boy loves these pacifiers they were the easiest ones for him to keep in his mouth and to find in his crib he s never looked back 
5 5 saw this on sharktank bought it for my sister who is expecting i was impressed with the quality it far exceeded my expectations the movement of the cords up and down is so smooth it doesn t even make a sound i love that it fits all types of pacifiers so you re not stuck buying only their pacifiers i wish i had another baby just so i could buy one for myself 
5 5 perfect size for diaper bag
5 5 very good item and good price 
5 5 great product 
5 5 excellent works much better than the 34 orthodontic 34 ones we also have never falls out
5 5 i love the handle on these and my baby loves to use them easy to clean and carry she outgrew her nuk 0 3 month pacifiers and i wanted to stick with one piece silicone and tried these exactly what we both wanted 
5 4 i love the wubbanub i would give it five stars except that they are not kidding when they recommend replacing them every six months we purchased the newest one on november 30th and just yesterday my 14 month old bit the end right off thankfully i caught the piece out of her mouth before it became a choking hazard she adores them though won t sleep without one i always said i was going to hold off on introducing the pacifier but the hospital nurse gave her a soothie pacifier when she was first born and it soothed her so much right away i was glad to see that soothie pacifiers are the ones wubbanubs come with because it s the only type of pacifier she prefers during those first few months the wubbanub definitely saved us from a lot of screaming what s not to love they re cute you can find the pacifier when your baby hides it in the blankets or whips it on the floor half the time when it falls the pacifier itself never even touches the ground they clean up easy with a bit of dish soap or in the laundry machine i buy them for all my girlfriends baby showers 
5 5 love this it s very soft with beanbag like feet that make it easy to prop up next to a sleepy fussy baby even though my almost 4 month old has started using the soothie part less often she still likes to cling to the frog and cuddle it in her sleep it s easy to wash and dry we take it everywhere we go 
5 5 these are the best pacifiers i bought so far they don t leave ugly marks on the kid s chubby little face my lil princess can keep these in her mouth for hours the adorable colors are a real bonus 
5 5 very cute little puppy 
5 5 good
5 1 this is way to big for an infants mouth not a very good grasp 
5 5 love these used them for a green bay packer diaper cake turned out great 
5 5 how did parents do it with only pacifiers in the old days this is awesome i ended up buying 2 because my son loves it so much meow we named the kitten is not heavy but just heavy enough that he won t be throwing the pacifier all over for us to chase he loves it and that makes us happy
5 5 perfect for a gift
1 1 love these pacifiers for my daughter but when i recieved them there was a hole in the end of one of them i didn t realize this until after she had swallowed a lot of air making her very colicy for the next week please be aware that they may have holes disappointed in this purchase switched pacifiers 
5 5 these are very similar to the kind given to our son in the hospital he prefers this kind and i love that since it s all one piece i don t have to worry about a choking risk from the base coming detached they don t say on them the age range they should be used for though so make sure you have them all gathered up before adding newer ones
5 5 he will only take this kindf thank you for carrying them
5 2 one of the pacifiers has some sort of hole or leak in it you can hear the air when the baby sucks it 
5 5 got this as a 34 congrats 34 gift when i first heard my friend was having a baby came in a timely manner and they loved it 
4 5 very useful but a little pricey 
5 2 my baby loves the mam brands of nuks and when he wakes up crying at night we constantly feel around his crib searching for a nuk so we thought we would give these a try they keep their charge about 15 minutes i have even left in a window all day to 34 charge 34 and it still fades so quickly we still use them because the baby still likes the nuk but the glow in the dark part is worthless 
5 5 baby loved it
5 5 my sons got to have his wubbanub everywhere we go 
5 5 the only pacifiers i would give my baby love them definitely soothing 
1 2 the soother wasn t sewed in all the way 
5 4 baby loves it doesn t leave home without it just wish you can exchange the pacifier
5 5 my baby loves his wubbanub s i love that they use the soothir like pacifier and the weighted toy makes it easy for baby to hold on to it helps bink stay in close position to baby s mouth and helps keep it from hitting the floor most of the time they are also a great toy for baby to play with plus they look super cute when baby is sucking on them my little guy pets his while falling asleep and it is the cutest thing ever these make the best gifts as well because you can never have too many wubbanub s 
5 5 both of my grandkids have used these love them so much i ordered these for my granddaughter who is expected to be here in may 
5 5 my son loves these pacifiers 
5 5 my twin greatfrandbaby that lives in north carolina mama says she loves this very much
5 5 great product nt have to worry about the later if the teeth will be pushed out great product 
5 5 our daughter loves this more as a little stuffed animal than for the pacifier but it s cute 
3 5 cute but comes in a bag
5 4 i thought this was so cute it makes my laugh 
5 5 we love our wubbanub our twins are 4 months old and they love to grip onto their stuffed animal while sucking on their paci also we seem to not loose it nearly as often then when their pacifier is alone the animal is super cute and the perfect size for their little hands 
5 2 glow in the dark please i was so excited when i saw these nothing is worse than dusting the floor with your pajamas as you blindly thrash under the crib in search of the pacifier trying to get the baby back to sleep this seemed like the perfect solution sadly these barely glow and even worse neither of my children will use it i have never seen my 20 month old turn down a pacifier just keep a spare pacifier ready for those late night wake ups 
5 5 my 5 month old loves her elephant wubbanub she puts every part of that elephant in her mouth though she won t take the pacifier 
5 5 great lve that the glow in dark 
5 5 best pacifiers 
4 4 perfect for my newborn i tried several other brands for 0 3 month olds but they gagged him because they were too long reduced by one star because i was sent girl colors green and purple instead of boy i figured it wasn t worth the hassle we just use the purple 34 girly 34 one at home 
5 5 baby loves it
5 5 my baby prefers these over teethers 
5 5 this is hysterical and looks so cute on my nephew got quickly
5 5 perfect for sleeping no hard plastic 
5 1 i thought i was going to recieve these adorable paci s that was shown one having a car and the other having a plane on it i was so excited until i opend them one had a motorcycle and the other a lions face i never seen that option listed 
5 5 good
5 5 my baby loves her pacifier she loves cuddling with the girafee
5 5 these glow nicely all night making them easy to find i like that they also come with a box for storage and sterilization 
3 3 the little stuff animals were cute but the pacifier itself aren t good really bad for developing of babies teeth 
5 5 my daughter loves it my husband loves it it looks so cute 
5 5 my son doesn t like any of the soother this one he likes the monkey and he keeps biting it as long as he likes it 
5 5 good
5 5 adorable as advertised great for baby shower
1 1 i am not going to get a chance to see if my baby likes this because it arrived open box and inner bag and the top of the nipple looks very scuffed and worn as if it s been used and chewed on not worth paying to send it back won t order again 
5 3 purchased this to put the families swim suits in for the summer the butterfly bag is a good size and feels strong the smaller bag i am still trying to figure out a use for it it s about the size of my hand from base of the palm to the tip of my middle finger 
5 3 i purchased these and the mam ones so i could find them at night and wanted to compare them these don t glow and the mams do i still gave them 3 stars because these are my little one s favorite type of pacifier he keeps it in his mouth the longest 
5 5 planning on bringing my new grandson south for a visit some time so i wanted him to fit in from the word go dressed in a pair of bib overalls and billy bob buck teeth will get the silver spoon spoiled in the womb little rascal over the mason dixon minus pretense a walmart gift card will accesorize him with the necessary fishin pole and bb gun for a good ole frog catchin expedition at grandpa s place on lil dogwood 
5 5 these will work great for my little one and they wasn t late
5 4 good
5 2 these are very disappointing they leave lots of residue behind 
5 5 does exactly what it says glows in the dark
5 5 some newborns are picky mine was one of those newborns we tried pacifier after pacifier and this was the only one she would take so we stuck with it they seem safe enough to use regularly she pretty much only uses them when she falls asleep but we ve never felt uncomfortable with her using them the colors are bright and fun and the clear plastic is simple and modern a word of advice as your baby gets older keep an eye on how they play with their pacifier at about four months my baby could fit a lot of this pacifier into her mouth which freaked me out don t forget to move up to the next size they make 3 6 and 6 when it s time 
4 4 my baby started out only taking mam pacifiers and i noticed that every time he had it his latch on my breast would be affected it took about two months but eventually he started taking these and i really notice the difference it does not affect his latch at all the only downside is that he seems to have a hard time keeping it in his mouth it falls out often 
4 4 product looks great but i have not tried it personally only complaint is i double ordered so i received 12 instead of 6 
5 5 baby s favorite type of pacifier
5 5 our son s new favorite mam he s always loved mam pacifiers but he reaches for this one the most 
5 5 who doesn t love a wubbanub this toy is so fun thank you 
5 5 good came fast
5 5 i gave this as a baby shower gift and everyone absolutely loved right now is handy for the baby for the pacifier and then when the baby gets old can remove the pacifier and they have an awesome toy to play with the parents loved it because it makes it easier to find while in the car 
5 5 absolutely adore these perfect for any baby
5 5 our daughter loves them
5 5 as does my grandson an avid clemson fan although he is unaware of this fact yet 
5 5 thanks
5 5 go to baby gift everyone loves them 
5 5 good
5 5 i bought this for my first great granddaughter and she loves it it is really easy to keep track of a pacifier when it is attached to a giraffe i bought the giraffe because it is my granddaughter s favorite animal 
5 5 great product and price these were the only ones my son would take 
5 5 i don t know why these didn t exist sooner they are perfect in the middle of the night when so you don t have to fish around for passy in the crib in the dark 
1 1 glowing only last 10 min tops useless after that what are you suppose to do the rest of the 34 night 34 
4 3 wish it was easier to open it sticks 
5 5 my 1yo uses pacifiers for nap time but for some reason won t graduate past the 0 3mo size 
5 5 great price
5 5 great
5 5 thank you so much i love it was as described and shipping and excellent 
5 5 baby loves it best pacifier to date and i have tried a lot 
5 5 these were awesome gave them to my niece as a fun item to use on her new child lots of fun and laughs and reasonably priced 
1 1 i very disappointed with this pacifier i was expecting i will get the same soft yellow soothie that came along with the avent bottles instead i got a very hard pacifiers i would never try giving it to my 4 months old son and hurt his palate and gums i also tried submerging the pacifiers in a not too hot water and see if a little hardness will go away but it is still the same waste of money 
5 4 nice
5 5 the wubbanub is a wonderful pacifier easy to hold find and clean 
5 3 this one looks a bit better but does not perform than the other cheap chinese product sold for half that much this one also looses grip frequently and needs to be removed and re mounted i expected more
1 2 did not work followed directions and tried online resources too no go
5 5 great light blanket for spring or fall
5 5 these are great bibs i love all the patterns my daughter is always drooling and was always wet these bibs are so so soft and they keep her totally dry it is great that they have 2 snaps so i can adjust the bib as she gets older excellent quality excellent product 
5 5 great product echo friendly and comfortable 
5 5 holds all my stuff in great looking case small enough to fit in a purse 
5 5 granddaughter loves it 
5 5 i purchased this when my child was just 2 months old simple not pink toys are cute and soft we interchange the toys with other toys she has sometimes and her all time favorite must have on the go toy is the owl this play activity comes with the little pillow is perfect for under her head or chest we play with this at least once a day in some way i recommend 
5 4 i ve bought of three or four graco boosters over the years and find the seat to be quite hard i have to add extra foam padding under the seat cover and then we re good to go but it d be wonderful if they had a little more comfort right out of the box love the color my 5 y o picked it out b c it reminded him of the aquarium 
4 4 would like it better if i could bent it
5 3 size runs very small 
5 3 the leg holes make it to where my son s legs stick out horizontally the placement makes no sense other than that height is easily adjustable easy to put together 
5 5 great transition diaper between newborn and one size snap downs in my opinion the one size diapers tend to bunch up a lot especially between the legs leaving your baby all wierdly shaped and bulky this one is much narrower in the crotch area you can perhaps get away by putting this on a chunky newborn 8lb but certainly won t fit you right out of the hospital the quality is good buy it elsewhere for 6 7 
2 2 does not adjust enough to point down 
5 3 very cute exactly like the picture 
4 4 these kick mats work well they attach in two places keeping them in place and they have a wire piped along the perimeter that keeps the overall shape so it doesn t get floppy and uncover what it s supposed to be protecting as another reviewer said the only complaint i have is that the swishy sound the nylon makes against my sons shoes encourages him to touch it with his feet but it s still better than muddy foot prints on the upholstery 
5 3 item exactly as described but as others mentioned it still leaks and hard to get fluids out 
5 5 best thing to happen to my sleep haha i am a very light sleeper and almost every noise will wake me up which is very frustrating after getting this and having it run all night i find that i am calmer and fall asleep faster and stay asleep because it drowns out all other noises i know this is for a baby but it definitely works for me an adult it has other sounds it can emit too but i just use it for the white noise would definitely recommend this to anyone needed help sleeping 
5 5 these are great they are large enough to cover the whole back side of a nissan titan front seat great service 
5 4 plenty of room for diapers and the velcro is holding up great the wipes lean over a little which is kind of awkward but it s holding up well 
5 5 worked like a charm only needed 1 extender 
5 5 this is a great product and arrived super fast i would recommend for anyone with a teething little one 
5 4 i like this a lot and recently bought a second one i like all the drawers and the hamper is very conveniant only thing after about 6 months of use the cloth ish drawers are starting to sag a bit 
5 5 great ty
5 5 i ve always loved mams but the glow in the dark are so great at night to help find them 
5 5 this thing has been a lifesaver it holds 2 pacifiers and 1 pacifier clip or it can hold 3 pacifiers without any clips i use the nuk pacifiers it will only really hold 2 smoothies at a time
5 5 thankfully we got the color we wanted my son loves these pacifiers since they are symmetrical not sold in a lot of stores so glad to find them here:)
5 5 excelente
5 5 excelente
5 5 great product
1 1 this had to of been one of my worst purchases ever this was shipped separately from the two other items i had ordered and shipping for this pacifier turned out to be double the purchase price ridiculous i also received it two ish weeks later than my two other purchases customer service from baby haven was the worst and this pacifier certainly is not as sparkly nor are the zebra stripes that black as it is shown in the photo the stripes are grey and it just looks super faded 
5 5 exactly what i thought it would be an easier more productive way to take care of your little one
5 4 we bought this brand as an alternative to the first years gumdrop variety we were looking for something light weight that would stay in the baby s mouth as opposed to the gumdrops which we were forever putting back in we bought the 3m so have been using it for almost 2months pros lightweight baby loves it easy to clip onto the clips that have the loops on the end baby has also been able to get the paci back in her own mouth because it is so light weight te gumdrops would pop out so fast cons it is easy to get shoved up closer to the nose as earlier reviewer said but it hasn t been a terrible problem since we are always with her also the comments you will get about the look of the paci will be endless since this is a newer paci and it s not mainstream yet not really a con just be prepared to explain to people it doesn t fit like a normal paci it doesn t really touch her face so she does have to suck continuously this hasn t seemed to bother the baby too much overall we are pleasantly surprised with this new find i thought it would be a difficult transition from the gumdrops but so far so good we found ours at target but am going to order the 6m very soon from here 
5 5 my new great grandson is only 1 month old so not quite ready for it but his mommy loves the idea of it can t wait to use it
5 5 baby isn t here yet so haven t used it yet but it is super cute can t wait to use it appears to be good quality still need to boil it before use tho exactly what i was looking for 
5 5 baby playing with it but she have never used it
5 5 i was skeptical about purchasing this because you can buy 6 of these pacifiers for the price of this one on a cat my daughter loves the soothie pacifiers but those dang things disappear so fast because they bounce and roll with the wubbanub i no longer have to worry about lost pacifiers my daughter loves playing with it and if the pacifier isnt in her mouth usually one of its legs are overall i think it was worth it because it keeps track of the pacifier for me it keeps the pacifier in place and it also gives my daugther something to entertain herself with i actually ended up ordering another 
5 5 my baby absolutely loves this we leave this as her pacifier in her crib and its almost like a security blanket for her she can hold on to it and feels comfortable it also helps to keep it in her mouth so you dont have to play the pacifier game until she falls asleep 
5 5 i get such a kick out of watching my lil guy when he uses this very well made sturdy good item 
5 4 everything ok as expected 
5 5 i love mam products
5 3 it s paper so it rips easy and you have to cute all the banks from this huge sheet and it takes so long if you want to do it perfectly because of the odd shape 
5 5 very good
2 2 my daughter just wouldn t take them 
5 5 bought this for my daughter her 1st child super cute idea seems easier to keep up with than a baby book good purchase 
5 5 these seem to work well for our little guy and he wears them without complaint 
5 5 love this thing it fits just about everything and i can throw it in the wash as is i can usually get the belt to wrap around something to keep her secured as well 
5 5 cute and lightweight my son really likes wearing this he has only worn it a few times but so far it has held up well 
5 4 the mattress that we purchased was a very nice mattress it works very well with the pack and play we purchased at a garage sale 
1 1 extremely poor quality the lid broke when my toddler dropped it stay away from this dont waste your money 
4 3 the bowl and spoon are nicely built very smooth my baby likes to chew on the spoon it is a good chewing toy for her the only think i do not like is that i need to put oil on them to make sure they will not crack i used coconut oil but it is not too healthy for baby 
5 5 keep our baby dry they re absorbant and the velcro is much better then the cheaper bibs looks cute too 
5 5 nice looking and very good quality 
5 4 pretty expensive for what it is 
5 5 these are my favorite bibs for the 34 drooly months 34 no velcro to mess with your other laundry or irritate baby s skin ten of them seemed like a lot at first but then there s always a clean one handy 
5 3 the hour piece broke off works great to track whether your on right and left 
5 5 cutest awesomest wall decor ever 
5 5 so so soft the baby loves it he is 5 mo old and it is one of his favorite things he holds it next to his cheek and dozes off definately 5 stars 
5 5 my son loves this play mat it s so bright colorful i love that it has the lights also the music you can put on a loud quiet option and also have it be on constantly or just when they hit one of the toys great for learning 
5 5 my son really likes the pillow and seem pretty comfortable 
4 4 my daughter is potty trained during the day but not yet at night after issues with traditional pull up diapers burning her skin due to chemicals we decided to try out cloth i am certainly very happy with the decision to change as her skin cleared up i like the fact that she can undo the velcro on her own if she needs to go to the bathroom at night we tried the snaps too but she complained they hurt her skin and were too difficult for her to get on and off the biggest downside that i was not expecting is the odor my daughter only goes 1 in them but even after we wash them they still smell as if they had just been used maybe that s common for cloth diapers if the smell went away after washing i would have given these 5 stars instead of 4 overall i like this product 
4 4 the scarf wasn t quite what i was expecting but it s still perfectly fine a better description for it would be a shall that can be worn as a scarf it s long in the back and front i am 5 6 34 and while standing it comes down to my waist and is pretty open on the sides but while sitting you can cover up perfectly fine i plan to put a button on each side to be completely covered for my own comfort the material is very light weight warning the material is slightly see through in the pictures it seems as though it is bold but it s more like a danskin shirt type of style 
5 4 my 18 month daughter loves this pillow she hadn t been using a pillow until she moved up to the toddler room at daycare she uses a sleeping mat at daycare but we have this pillow at home she asks for it when we re relaxing in the living room we ve yet to use it in her crib but i m sure she ll love it when we do start 
3 3 for the price this is beautiful however it is not nearly as large as i anticipated and yet despite its small size it s an i credible amount of pieces to put together the manufacturer their to save paper and therefor put every limb and piece of limb separately to jigsaw them on a few pieces they easily could have made it never by putting larger pieces of the tree together on a page and the little leaves and animals on a separate page we figured it out but there while every piece was labeled with a number there was no completed numbered diagram to show where the numbers went the biggest dissapointment though is that the pieces are see through even though that is not displayed in the images online if you put an owl in front of a piece of tree the tree shows through the owl and it s ugly i got around this by chance going up the scene but you can t set it up as they did their image is digitally enhanced 
5 3 wanted to love these based on other reviews no matter how many times my husband and i try to close these cups correctly they leak at the seal disappointing 
5 4 looks good
5 5 given as gift to niece seemed to like it a great idea for the teething little ones 
5 5 looks really nice can t wait to use it for my babies smash cake
5 5 exactly what i wanted now i can t wait until my grandson gets here to see him using it it s super super adorable 
5 3 very bulky and does not fold up very small looks nice but at 32 lbs and not small it was not fitting in my car trunk sent back and got the britax b agile and very happy with it 
4 4 i like this carrier but it can be a pain putting it on and taking it off because the straps are super long 
5 5 i m so happy to have found this bottle sippy cup for my baby i wanted to stay away from plastic bottles and this was the answer very well made and sturdy also well thought out with there being no plastic parts even when adding in the optional straw pura offers very happy 
5 5 our two and a half month baby absolutely loves this she will lay in her crib for a long time just staring at it love that it has a light and so many different options of what to listen to including a heartbeat 
5 5 these pouches are really great we love them so much i just bought a second package we have put all kinds of stuff in there from homemade veggie and fruit purees to yogurt mixed with fruit to applesauce all different textures do great in these my daughter has no issues getting out even the thicker ones all the things we used to feed her with a spoon we can now put in these pouches making eating on the go and at daycare and feeding the baby when we re trying to cook dinner and eat too so much easier since she can do it herself we have been using them for about a month and so far have not had any instances of the pouches opening when they shouldn t they can go in the dishwasher but we found we prefer to wash them by hand with the bottle brush in the very bottom of the pouch where the bottom meets the sides there is often food stuck in there that doesn t come out in the dishwasher we just use the small brush part of our bottle brush to clean that part out without issue also dirty water from the dishwasher cycle tends to collect in the outside of the pouch when we stand it upside down in the top rack yuck we send these to daycare and since a few other moms have bought them after seeing how much we like ours labeling is a must but i have found that the sharpie washes off the name tag on the back i solved that by putting a small piece of transparent tape over her name i also really like the color and design very thankful that they are not in cutesy shapes also do yourself a favor and when buying these or for that matter any refillable pouch buy the funnel pitcher too chunkier purees go in much cleaner and easier when using the pitcher not necessary but for less than 5 you ll be glad you did this is a great product buy some for yourself 
5 5 i absolutely love it n so does my 4month old daughter faith
5 5 great product my daughter loves them for her yogurt 
5 3 easy to install not easy to walk with when using the city mini jogger the handle on the stroller doesn t allow enough room for both you and the child you have to walk leaning forward to allow room for a childto stand between you and the stroller doesn t work well for going on a walk around the neighborhood but it will do for s trip to the mall or zoo when you are not constantly walking 
5 5 great addition to our bedding set love how it ties neatly at the end of the crib for easy access out of the way but still a nice accent to add to the room s dcor 
1 3 hate logistics too slow but something good 
5 5 we have been using charlie banana cloth for a while but i was gifted some disposable liners no idea the brand and just recently ran out so i ordered these we love them first of all because they fit the diaper perfectly my last liners were too big and i had to fold them the charlie banana liners are so so soft they catch all the poo and we flush them and have had no problem with them clogging the toilet i will continue to use these as long as we cloth diaper 
5 3 i m using this to freeze baby food for my daughter and i find it really tedious and challenging to pop the cubes out once they re frozen i m sure they re trying to save freezer space by running the cubes vertically but this would be much easier if the cubes froze horizontally 
5 4 works in a pinch 
5 5 my son is three and i ve been looking around for a toddler pillow this comes with a pillow and pillow case great for a starter bed set the pillow is very comfortable yet firm 
5 5 i really like that there are no suction cups on this shade it is really easy to move around and seems to diffuse sunlight very well you can see through the shades but of course it is not like looking through window glass i would recommend them 
5 1 why on earth are these made from terry cloth 
5 5 nice product love it
5 5 a gift
5 4 comes with a case to keep it clean and is easy for the little ones to hold
5 5 mirror is great it is huge which means a lot easier to see you little one super adjustable and sturdy beats all other mirrors we have had 
5 3 they are pretty much what i expected work well and i love being able to feel confident that i am not being rude by changing and disposing my child s diaper when out and about 
3 4 they gave me two of the green print and two grey prints i was looking forward to the moo cow print but it wasn t included the do hold up to one 15 old month pee accident so i can t complain about the quality of the product just that the picture of it was deceiving
5 5 love this piggy bank just what i was looking for 
5 5 it was perfect for the bassinet nice quality tracer
5 5 great product as described sturdy easy to clean and natural our daughter loves it 
3 3 these have thicker firmer silicone my baby personally would not accept these compared to the 0 3 mo ones perhaps when he is older he wouldn t mind them 
5 5 my daughter is 18 months old and still loves her 34 froggie 34 she s been using it since she was a few months old i had to get another one as a backup when the other one needed to be cleaned 
1 1 doesn t stay in my daughter s mouth covers her nose so obstructs breathing don t waste your money i bought this as it was a cheaper option to the gumdrop brand should have paid the extra money to get the ones i liked these are just going in the garbage now :(
5 5 this is similar to the hospital brand 
5 5 so cute 
1 1 my baby hates this never used it total waste of money
1 1 wife hate these shape of nipple is weird baby would will not take these for me 
5 5 perfect baby shower gift 
5 5 this is a lifesaver especially during the newborn stages it keeps the pacifier in place and keeps you from searching for lost pacifiers 
4 4 but it s clear easy to lose when baby spits it out otherwise great product 
5 5 the kid loves these pacifiers we ve tried other kinds but he only wants these 
5 5 works perfect for our baby since 1 week old doesn t squeeze the nose or anything and big enough for baby starting at 2 weeks old to keep an hand on it and avoid falling all the time when laying down on the side 
5 5 these are my favorite brand of nuks 
5 5 my little one had a hard time with the avent nipples when he was first born this fit more easily into his little mouth and helped with the gas he was getting from improper suction a lot of people think the construction is overly complicated but there aren t any more parts than in an avent bottle i love these bottles and wish i had found them for my first baby 
3 3 i give it a 3 star for being cute but was disappointed in the size all together it was way smaller than i thought it would really be 
1 3 i chose what i thought were the pacifiers pictured instead i got other designs i m not sure why too much of a hassle to return since i needed them asap for a baby shower 
5 5 great product my baby loves it super fast delivery 
5 5 babies love this one
3 3 very cute wubby but it is more turquoise than the pic can t decide if it s too girly for a boy 
1 4 too hard 
5 5 best binkies ever i even bought the pink for my son who uses them when sleeping because i couldn t find the blue i wish they weren t discontinued the only binkies my son will use 
5 5 i love these i can fit two of the gumdrop pacifiers in them and the other brand of rubber pacifiers 
3 5 these are the only kind my newborn will take unfortunately we ended up getting the pink pack for our baby boy since you don t get to pick the color but for around the house they ll work 
5 5 i love it
5 5 really cute
5 5 only pacifier our baby will take these wonderful silicone rubber blobs had saved us many sleepless nights 
5 5 great product 
5 5 this is the only brand my daughter loves came through in the clutch for me thank you 
5 5 love it
5 5 i have foster babes and they all love this brand our children s hospital uses it buying the six pack means i can always find one when i need to well usually 
5 5 he liked it for a bit until he quit the paci on his own around 4 mo old 
5 4 like others tommee tippee is the only brand my baby would take he refused all the others we tried the only down side of the clear is that it is invisible nearly impossible to find even in a well lit room and forget about finding it on white sheets the up side of this is that it looks better in pictures than other pacifiers as he does not look like he has a giant piece of plastic covering half his face 
5 5 these pacifiers are great every new mother i have given them to loves them 
5 1 um a new mother nd i had to set my baby 34 s feeding schedules bcs initially baby dsnt know much difference between suckin and feeding and to avoid all time crying we need to pacify him time to time i was using avent pacifiers previously n they came with a cap too for hygiene then later i bought these to giv a try and was really disappointed bcs my 2 month baby didnot like it at all so um happy with my previous ones :)
2 2 rip off 
5 5 was very pleased with the product and the service i recieved 
5 5 very good just love it
5 5 i adore these wubbanubs my daughter has had the lamb since she was born and it s gotten a little ragged i wanted to order another one because i pull my hair out trying to find it when it s lost i loved the colors of this one and the ease of holding it since it s shape it doesn t seem as soft as the lamby but it s adorable and i am glad we had another to add to our collection 
5 5 cute and very durable
5 1 this is not the real one i have an original one and this one isn t feel the same so disspointed
5 5 glow in the dark pacifiers are the only ones we use at night because they are so much harder to lose 
5 4 loved it with the exemption that you can take off the pacifier to clean it other then that my baby loved it oh and its not heavy where it pulls the pacifier out of the baby s mouth 
5 5 fast shipping product was new and my son loves his monkey 
5 5 cute pacifier goes great with baby cowboy hat and bib also sold on amazon nice shower gift 
5 5 love these the best yet shipped and delivered on time 
5 5 very good just love it
5 5 exactly as described 
5 5 i like that they make a clicking sound from the handle hitting the shield when they drop so you can somewhat tell where they go in the middle of the dark night hha ;)
5 1 nipple broke very quickly ive owned tons of wubbanubs this one broke super fast
5 3 wish i would have been able to pick a color my little boy now has pink binks lol
5 3 not exactly like picture but affordable usable and cute 
3 3 i like the idea but baby didn t like the paci i ll keep trying but for now he just spits it out 
1 3 i received this product all in one bag not individually wrapped in manufacturers packaging like i had thought other than that they seemed to be new but i suppose there is no way of really knowing 
5 5 item just as described just what i was looking for great doing business with thanks a 
5 2 it doesn t hold much stuff insid it s suitable for not more than 4 bottles with their accessories it doesn t dry 100 as well even after 60 minutes program and an overnight stay inside the sterilizer i f you imagine its a magic all in one solution for your little one s bottols i think you should think twice because you may be wrong 
5 5 the only pacis my daughter will take 
5 2 these are curved so they leave red marks on my 1 month olds s little cheeks :(
5 3 my 6 month old he didn t quite like it as much as i thought he will 
5 5 my daughter loves them very easy to clean 
3 3 my child didn t like them that much 
5 5 item just as described just what i was looking for great doing business with thanks a 
5 5 my go to gift whenever anyone has a baby every item i m bought from the wubbanub collection is adorable 
5 5 best pacifier ever love that the product has bottles as while
5 5 both of my children love their wubbanubs the plush animal makes it easy for babies to find the pacifier at night saving mom from running into the nursery all night when they wake up they last forever even my toddler s tug of war couldn t rip the pacifier from the plush just throw it in the washing machine for easy cleaning 
5 4 my baby loves this pacifier and i love it too it s soft and doesn t leave indentation lines on his face the only negative thing is that because it s natural rubber it discolors to a dingy brown after a few weeks and i feel like people who use the cheaper plastic pacifiers are judging me because my kid has a crazy dirty hippie binky 
5 4 i bought it as a baby shower present and they loved it
5 5 my 2 month old grabbed it which is a good sign 
5 5 the only pacifier my son will take 
4 2 i was so excited to try these but my son won t take them i thought since i was breastfeeding he d like that these flex like a breast when sucked but he doesn t care about that at all the size and shape of the nipple deems a bit odd to me and i suspect it s what he doesn t like the only pacifier he ll take is the soothie save yourself some money and buy a pack of those if your baby doesn t like them then start trying out others i wish i d done that before i d spent 7 on these 
5 1 these have a hole in the tip which my son does not like i thought i was ordering the same version of what he was given at the hospital and loves but it is into 
4 1 one star because i still love avent pacifiers but i was thinking that buying a 34 glow in the dark 34 pacifier meant it would actually glow in the dark :(
1 3 disappointed as i did not receive the ones in this picture 
5 5 cute
5 5 excelente
5 5 funny 
5 5 son loves these 
5 5 just a cool pasifier everybody gets a laugh
5 5 bought for a gift for baby shower in june 
5 5 bien bien
5 4 good soft and no smell
5 5 great quality teat is shaped like a mam pacifier 
5 5 my babies love these had them from the hospital as well 
5 5 great pacifier holder cute useful and protective
5 5 helps my daughter keep her pacifier in hermouth hhopefully she does it herself soon 
5 5 perfect son loves them 
5 4 one of a kind pacifier it helps the pacifier stay on baby s mouth for the first 6 months if the parents choose to co sleep with their babies also the animal character helps baby to find the pacifier easily when baby wakes up 6 months and older can be washed in the washer my kid loves it 
3 3 pacifier is a great concept but the nipple is too long for a baby to easily use 
3 3 this seems ok so far although the baby is not here yet to put it to the real test it s definitely cute and comical i didn t like that it came in a little cellophane wrapper as opposed to an acutal package it s kind of hard to tell if you got what you paid for when there is no packaging it appears sturdy and i don t think it will give us any trouble but i really would have liked atual packaging i think it would be a cute gift but would never give someone some random pacifier in a cellophane wrapper 
5 5 shop for my friends she told me that her baby loves this i think the baby likes it which shows the product is a good one 
5 5 very chic not bulky whatsoever enough space for two mam pacifiers
5 1 my little guy hates this thing it either falls out of his mouth bc it s too heavy or he yanks it out immediately 
5 5 glow in the dark passies totally completely brilliant 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my ebf son will take 
5 5 these are my favorite pacifiers the best 
5 5 these little guys are the best my babies loved them and the animal is not only cute but useful as it lets smaller babies hold the pacifier in place long before they would be able to with a regular pacifier 
5 5 my daughter loves these
5 5 my little one loves these pacifiers he refuses to accept any other they are so flipping adorable too the little button design makes you wanna smooch your baby incessantly these also fit well with the mam paci holders also a great product little one votes yes 
3 5 ok
3 2 i liked the idea but my daughter won t take them
5 5 great product
3 5 ok
5 5 my daughter was thrilled and surprised by this as a early childhood educator she loves this product 
5 5 my 2 month daughter loves it 
4 5 i gave these a five star because they are good quality and i wanted them to work but my son wouldn t have it he is ebf and only takes the mam pacifiers 
3 3 the rubber part on these was not the orthodontic shape i expected it was more bulbous my son did not use them 
5 5 very nice items for a little cowboy 
5 5 my bby loved it 
5 5 i bought this one for my second child because my daugther loved it it s easy to grab i don t have to worry about loosing pacifiers it s easy to find if misplaced definitely a product i would recommend or gift 
5 5 got these for my granddaughter who spends time here and is sometimes without her paci arrived right on time and she loves them 
5 5 great size for my little 14mo baby flat little plastic thing to suck on good size she popped it in her mouth right away and had no cares in the world :)
4 3 smaller than i expected based on the price think mini bean bag animal size 
5 5 excellent
5 5 fine
5 5 critical to have on hand for a newborn do not leave home without one our baby was not a huge pacifier kid but these are still amazing when they need to be soothed this is typically what the hospital gives you too 
5 5 it works very well philips avent has always been our trusted brand 
5 4 one piece construction makes it easy to clean with no crevices to harbor bacteria handle makes it easy for baby to grab we started using these at 5 months before this she had the wubbanub which is only for babies up to 6 months or without teeth 
5 5 my baby liked these the best 
5 5 i m not sure how i got by without these consider this one slightly smaller and lighter than the 4 legged ones available my son went for this turtle first when he was 8 months due to the smaller compact size 
1 1 this is the most useless pacifier clip ever the design is attractive and the stitching is nice but all that matters nought when the clip to secure to baby s clothes is so short and weak really worse than useless cause the clip just falls off all the time and baby ends up mouthing it and toy falls to the ground 
5 5 i used them to replace the pacifier on my son s wubbanub worked great just used a thimble and it was easy enough to poke holes to see through 
5 4 to each their own my first one liked these a lot the second one has been spitting it out from the day she was born i would like a hole in the paci handle for a strap 
5 5 love these pacifiers the colors are very cute 
5 5 this cute lil zebra arrived in just 5 days my new grandson is going to love it 
5 5 we absolutely loved them 
5 5 excellent
5 4 cool
5 5 great quality and super fast shipping i ll be back 
5 5 my son doesnt use them much but they are nice when he does
5 4 it does what it s suppose to do
5 5 excellent
5 5 my son loves it
5 5 very comforting for a little one 
5 5 great quality easy to wash i m obsessed with wubbanubs and would purchase one of each if my husband would allow it 
5 5 baby loved it says it all 
5 1 they get all cloudy and gross looking if you wash them in the dishwasher 
5 5 super fast shipping great product excellent seller i needed this for a baby shower and the seller got it to me super fast would definitely recommend and buy again thank you 
5 5 best pacifier out there
1 2 ordered 2 one of the packs was not translucent 
5 5 everyone at our party enjoyed this game :)
5 4 good pacifier with cover for better sanitation
5 5 mam pacifiers are the only ones our baby will take and the glow in the dark makes it much easier to find when he drops it in the middle of the night 
5 2 it s small and my baby saw it threw it on the ground and never wanted to look at it again 
5 5 great idea for a pacifier keeps it from falling and a soft animal for baby to hold
5 5 my baby loved it helped her to hold it in her mouth better and she loves holding it and cuddling it 
5 5 perfect for the diaper bag the small pacifier wet bag is great for silverware too 
5 5 my son loves these 
3 5 cute toy but my baby prefers other pacifier instead
5 3 ok product fun for baby shower
3 2 my daughter likes the pacifiers just fine but the glowing does not last through the night and they aren t very bright to begin with 
5 5 as expected
5 5 the only pacifier my nephew would use and hard to find thanks 
3 2 my baby can t keep it in his mouth i think the nipple profile is too thin weird what was really cool though was the sanitizing box it comes in 
5 5 thank you 
5 5 love these can easily be sanitized without the nasty seems that other brands have the quality is fantastic i own about 20 of these one for just about everywhere 
5 5 we bought these cause they were recommended since we were breastfeeding but my daughter ended up never taking a pacifier they really do glow in the dark which makes it easy to find them and they look like they would be great 
5 4 goes with the blanket don t know about the product til the baby gets here
5 5 very handy i like the idea that it s machine washable and it s in perfect condition even after multiple rounds in the dryer my babies love them we have already ordered three of these 
5 5 i ve had 5 breastfed babies 4 of whom completely refused any kind of pacifier my youngest baby is a month old seems to really like his natursutten pacifier he still prefers the breast for comfort but will take this pacifier in the car or when someone else is holding him i m ordering 2 more today so we always have one one hand 
5 5 wubbanubs are just amazing i mean you should probably take out stock in the company 
5 5 good 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 so fun 
3 5 ok
5 5 it is great the baby will love it
5 5 good
5 5 we had various reasons to use a pacifier very early on in my baby s life we never had nipple confusion using this brand 
5 5 my grandson loves it 
5 5 such a cute wubbanub my baby loves it 
5 5 my baby loves loves loves his wubbanub i actually got two for him frog and elephant he enjoys being able to cuddle with the stuffed animal while soothing himself to sleep with the pacifier brilliant 
5 5 nice 
5 5 i bought these pacifiers at target a week ago and these are the only pacifiers that my 3 month baby has taken for longer than 5 seconds he is breastfed and breastmilk bottled fed too we tried the smoothies that we got at the hospital those only worked for a short time he no longer wants them we also tried the nuk ones but he just didn t want them i gave him the tommee tippee and he took it i recommend these for anyone 
3 5 ok
5 5 baby loves it 
5 5 these are by far my granddaughters favorite she can put them in either way and it doesn t matter highly recommend 
5 5 bought as a gift for a friend because my son loved his puppy wubbanub every picture i see of their little girl she is cuddling with the little zebra it is super cute in person i love that it s not the popular ones you see at the big baby stores 
5 5 love these pacifiers so much easier to find when dropped than the normal soothie and at 4 months my son is able to occasionally get it back in his mouth thanks to the arms and legs of the puppy these wash up really well too 
5 5 my 3 month old has loved this since she was 2 weeks old she can hold its paws and keep it by her mouth and it is easy for me to find at night if she drops it 
5 4 these are great for the middle of the night when it s completely dark and your baby decides hey wouldn t it be funny if i just tossed this thing out of my mouth and have my mommy search for it in a panic because it s the only thing that keeps me from crying glow in the dark awesome 
5 5 so sweet and stays in great 
5 5 love these pacifiers they have been a lifesaver for us since day 1 and after 4 months of use they are still going strong 
5 5 what is there to say if you have a binky baby these do the trick for keeping them quiet and content love the product but hoping to break mine from the unnessasary sucking that she loves to do all day and night time for my babe to learn other coping skills :)
5 5 bought this basket as a gift for a friend who just had a baby boy i was able to get it delivered to her house which was wonderful because we live far from each other it was delivered to her a few days after i ordered it and she absolutely loved it i would rrecommend this product to anyone who want to give a lovely gift for newly born 
5 5 this was the only paci one of my kids would take just had another little one a few days ago and he has already taken to this with zero issues 
1 5 not bad 
1 1 i received this set today with two pacifiers i washed it before give it to my 5 weeks old baby boy guess what did i see there is water stay in the pacifier is this mean this is a broken one or it s just a low quality pacifier see pic i attached i want to return it but i already opened other bottles don t buy it 
5 5 hilarious quite strong and durable extremely good for a giggle even funny when adults use them 
5 5 it was just what i wanted the baby likes it better than others i ordered more than one the company sent them separate they should try to combine all purchases into one shipment
5 5 perfect
1 3 did not receive the color pictured 
5 5 works like a charm very easy to use highly recommended
3 3 i ordered the clear of these pacifiers and wound up getting the purple in my order not a huge deal but not what i expected i do like the fact these come with a cover to pop on prior to throwing them in the diaper bag 
3 4 i loved it and looks so cute however my son didnt like it he rolled it around in his mouth instrad of sucking on it gaged and spit it out i did get the round and maybe should have gotton the orthodontic type since thats was he gravitates to unfortunily its so expensive im not willing to buy another to see but it is super cute 
5 5 daughter in law loved it 
5 5 it arrived the next day my grandson loves it 
5 4 perfect for a gift
5 5 love it the little bit of weight it has in the feet helps it to stay in my 2 month old s mouth i will be ordering another animal 
5 5 the plush animal helps keep the pacifier from rolling away once the baby has let go of it or spit it out we find these to be one of the best baby purchases we have made 
5 5 love it can out on diaper bag or throw in purse 
5 5 this pacifier is worth it s weight in gold it s genius the little giraffe helps to keep the pacifier close to my daughters mouth even if she spits it out so she is able to put it back in instead of needing to cry for me at night i put this on her tummy and so when she wakes her pacifier is right there to help her back to sleep immediately a must have for any parent 
1 1 this isn t the real wubbanub don t waste your money 
5 5 mom to be was excited to have these glow in dark pacifiers baby not here yet so not sure how well they are working out for her 
5 4 both of my boys have loved these pacifiers they are the only ones that i have ben able to get them to take i love that they are translucent and some have a little bit of color 
5 5 great purchase 
5 5 we are always loosing these good value 
1 1 one of the ears was not sewn all the way on i trying calling to get a replacement but was never called back 
5 1 pacifiers were not clear as pictures and described 
5 5 great game for a baby shower a lot of cards
5 5 this is so wonderful i love that it dries everything such a time saver plus it gives extra piece of mind knowing the bottles pump parts pacis are extra clean 
5 5 excelent product just as described and shipping fast
5 5 i bought these for my 4 month old son he has loved the original soothie so i wanted to try these the 34 super soothie 34 as they call it they are stiffer and the rubber base is a bit thicker he really enjoys them i think they feel more like a finger which is his usual preference if he can grab someone s hand he likes to switch between the softer and harder ones depending on his mood i just wish they made the wubbanubs with the option of this one 
5 5 good product
5 5 these are the only nuks that our daughter will take 
5 4 love it just wish the animal and pacifier weren t attached 
5 5 our daughter loved this paci
5 5 good
5 5 great paci s 
5 5 our granddaughter just loves this thing 
5 2 too big for age marked 
4 1 only came with two but overall i liked them
5 5 good product
5 4 works as advertised 
5 5 sturdy and lightweight ideal for our visiting young onesi n our community clubhouse 
5 3 i was surprised by how thin these are i m not sure i ll have any use for them 
5 5 no leaks and a great price 
5 5 love it
5 5 i got a c r gibson baby memory book for one of my other kiddos and loved all the detail included so i would definitely recommend 
5 5 my 1 year old daughter has been wearing this all winter our house drops to about 62 degrees at night and she is very comfortable sleeping with this and fleece feety pajamas she s had a few accidents and a noseblood and a vomiting incident being a parent is so much fun and it has laundered very well the zipper tucks up nicely in the little cloth slot and it s actually very possible that she ll still fit in it next winter when she s 2 5 she s a slightly above average height average weight toddler it might just be a coincidence but she was having horrific sleep problems before we bought this and she s been mostly sleeping through the night ever since it breaks my heart to think that she might have been cold that whole time and our last double pjs blanket weren t sufficient but who really knows if you live in a cold drafty farmhouse and you turn the heat down at night this is the sleeping bag to get for your toddler you won t be sorry 
4 5 my 2 year old loves this thing it is way bigger than i thought it would be which was a bonus it lights up different colors only when in water still don t understand how that works but it is cool 
5 5 everyone loved them at my baby shower very cute and fun :)
5 5 son s favorite 
5 5 great buy 
5 5 i first received a free sample of bamboobies from a sampling event on facebook and when i tried them i fell in love with them i then immediately went out and bought a whole box they are so soft and comfortable all the other nursing pads i have tried stick to my nipples the first time you leak even the smallest amount and they do not stay aligned with my nipples throughout the day the bamboobies nursing pads are perfect there was no sticking leaking smell or movement from the pads i have found my new favorite nursing pad 
5 5 works great and my daughter loves her stool 
5 1 i had to glue some of the baby sign back n hook baby back too 
4 4 pretty easy to install it takes a bit of trial and error to get the inside part of the lock in the right place the adhesive is really strong so be sure that you don t press it down onto the cabinet until you have it in the right place otherwise it s really hard to get off my only complaint is that they way they are set up means that even when they are locked you will be able to open the cabinet slightly like half an inch it ll work fine for kidproofing or my purpose earthquake proofing my cabinets since i live in california but it would have been nice if it locked the cabinet without you being able to even open them a tiny bit 
5 5 these are very soft i was very happy to see that they are organic and the bamboo is from a sustainable forest it said exfoliation so i was nervous about them being scratchy but they weren t at all i was very pleased to use these on my baby on my big kids and even on my self for washing my face they have cute designs on them that could be given for a boy or a girl if you were looking for a shower gift or if you didn t know the sex very nice i did receive these for free or a reduced price in exchange for my honest review as seen above 
5 5 i buy these sheets to tie dye for my shop at happy yiayia tie dye on etsy 
1 1 do not buy is please don t
5 5 this is the only pacifier our granddaugher will take it s also adorable 
5 5 love the ties that secure it to the rails they are longer then other brands i ve bought and are also a bit stretchy making it so easy to tie 
4 4 watch https youtu be dwfck9vbg18 for in depth detail demonstration and explanation it does the job my baby will fall asleep quicker when swaddled he is a pretty strong four month old and breaks out of a traditional blanket swaddle with this one he has to try harder and sometimes doesn t get out however he is only 17lbs and the large swaddleme on their website said it is good up to 20 lbs i have a very difficult time connecting the velcro on the final flap it barely touches even after readjustments i don t want him to be squeezed too tightly he is transitioning out of being swaddled but i still want to use this when i can the velcro is very loud and when i m trying to put him to bed it sometimes stirs him awake when i have to unvelcro it two is recommended in case there is an accident like pee then you have a back up for the rest of the night 
5 5 very cute
5 5 this product is high quality i was afraid it would be of a cheap material i highly recommend it it was delivered faster than the estimated delivery 
5 3 have to change the batteries a lot
5 5 i just received this bumper i loved first i got scared with the size because even if you know the mesure before buy you would be waiting for something smaller anyway is very good thing i personaly put the two pieces together under the shhetsto make it longer on the edge of my soon s bed is so confortable not hard no smells and keeps the sahpe even if you seat on top of like i do sometimes to read to my soon i use to have pillow under his sheets and still worry that he could fall of the bed but now i can sleep with no worries he is well protected and confortable i think this could be covered with some kind of fabric to be over perfect 
1 1 horrible i ordered this set specifically for the cow it didn t come with the other 2 when i told them they said they d reship so i let my kid have the other ones then after they said they d reship i get an email saying they are out of that one i would have returned them all had i known i wouldn t get that one 
5 5 best pacifier for my baby
5 4 my baby liked these when he was under 3 mths worth the money for that time frame these become a chocking hazard as the child grows so please refrain from use after 3 mths
5 5 the baby loves these and the travel case is a great addition to the diaper bag easy to clean and store 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my kids would will take they love them and i ve tried several others and they refuse them one thing i don t like is that i feel like junk gets caught in or around the actual pacifier part that goes in their mouth and that disgusts me i try to keep it clean but it s just one more thing to remember and i wish it could be designed so that it wasn t so hard to clean i worry about what gets inside it as i ve seen water in there and have no way of getting it out otherwise i love them because my kids love them :)
1 1 the description needs to state that the pacifier cannot be removed to be cleaned and sanitized total waste of money 
5 5 works great and seems to be accurate
5 5 even when it s not in his mouth he loves to hold onto it we received the giraffe as a gift from my work my son loved it so much that we had to buy another 
5 5 would not leave home without it 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers that my 3 week old likes they absolutely save the day when my daughter is being fussy i absolutely love these pacifiers 
5 5 great for baby to hold on to 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my breastfed daughter will accept i like the design it s slightly curved so that it contours to her mouth it does not have a up or down side like the nuk paci which makes it easier for me to place it in her mouth and it s easier for her to put it back in her mouth as well there is a protective cap that covers the nipple of the nipple which is nice because i can just throw one in my bag and not worry about it getting gross you can sterilize these as needed i just pop them in a microwave steam bag with my breast pump parts 
5 5 this are my son s favorite
5 4 these were nice to have the first couple weeks with both of our boys the soother always helped when they had gas and didn t need to nurse or when in their car seat to comfort them i only really got use out of it the first month or two so i only really needed the one pack both times these soothers are inexpensive so worth having just in case 
5 5 thank you
5 4 works great you have to squeeze the sides in order do open 
5 5 awesome my baby loves this pacifier lovey combo 
5 5  
5 5 i love this wubbanub so much it s my favorite however if you are looking for this wubbanub that is not a counterfit and doesn t fall apart buy it from buybuybaby com it s cheaper i got mine for 12 99 and it s the right one i don t know about this one and it s way more expensive but the wubbanubs in general are amazing we have a lamb and a caterpillar and just bought this lamb again on buybuybaby for a baby shower i m attending in april 
5 5 never lose a nanny again great product and my daughter loves it 
5 5 thanks
5 3 well my experience with these pacifiers i was very excited waiting for them for my 7 months old baby the shipping was very fast too soon they are cute one piece completely silicone and suitable for my baby s mouth but are so flexible and soft that cause me fear that an accident happens bends easily an anxious baby teething put things in their mouth i think it s a little dangerous im using them because i pay for them and bought 4 and also my baby likes but i confess i m super alert and try to tie the paci to his nunu burp cloth 
5 5 my baby loves these mam pacifiers and the glow in the dark helps us find them and pop them back in 
5 5 my daughter loves hers sometimes when she s not sucking on the pacifier she just plays with it makes it easy for us to find her pacifier i didn t think it was heavy enough to keep from falling out if she was moving her head a lot but it was definitely better than the paci alone 
5 1 gets in the baby s way and attracts any and all dust and hair which sticks to the paci
4 4 everyone gets a kick out of this including my baby although her focus is more taking it out and chewing the mustache my only problem is that even at six months she s still not too fond of having it as a pacifier she doesn t like how the actual pacifier part is shaped since it s so long even though she s a big girl maybe it s just her though either way i d totally buy these again 
5 5 these are too cute and i can t wait to give them to my new grandbaby 
5 4 got this set to store my pump parts between sessions at work i use the larger bag and the drawstring and flexibility makes this easy to 34 mold 34 thus saving room in my pump bag it s also washable and has kept up very well after daily use 
5 5 these bottles are pretty great imo i admit there are a lot of parts to take apart and clean but you get used to it like everything else mine have only leaked when i don t screw them properly i have a 5 week old fussy girl and these are great for her 
5 5 these are easy to find when your baby has spit it out in the middle of the night 
5 5 i love these pacifiers okay my baby loves them so much we have bought them since our baby was a newborn we have used all sizes and our son still uses them fantastic product 
5 5 my baby loves these we tried several different pacifiers nuk hospital freebie and the one with the stuffed animal attached when my daughter was born and she didn t take to any of them i figured she was just one of those babies that don t like pacis and i was fine with that however one of these came free with my chicco carseat purchase i thought nothing of it but offered it to her and she loved it she s 5 months old and has been using these since newborn love them 
5 5 once you know which pacifiers your child likes then get them in bulk these have been through high abuse by our child and run through the dishwasher top rack many times they are easy for them to hold pick up if your child likes this style then these are great i would purchase again due to their high durability 
5 5 glow in the dark pacifiers are the most wonderful invention of all time 
5 5 best video baby monitor in this price range i am a mother to three boys ages 3 2 and newborn i have owned 5 video monitors 3 of them being summer infants that all broke in under a year i was distraught over the amount of money i was spending and the hassle over returning monitors i then switched things up and went with this monitor i have this monitor and three cameras the transition in scanning room to room is brilliant for parents of multiple little kiddos it keeps track of the kids temperatures in their rooms and also has an option to talk to your kids in the monitor i just recently bought this monitor for the second time as a backup to our first one and so we have one to set up at grandmas this monitor is sturdy reliable and easy to use the only monitor you ll ever need 
5 5 good quality fits well and looks nice
5 2 the images rub off very quickly we had for about a month and couldn t even tell what they were supposed to be anymore i bought these solely for the crown and castle 
5 5 my children love it it s long enough to fit my 2 and 3 year old when they want to brush their teeth and wash their hands together it s light enough for my girls to move it from the toilet and back to the sink i have no complaints 
5 5 greatest stroller in the world if you can only have one all purpose stroller this is the one we bought ours late 2007 and started using it with our first child in feb 2008 we are now on our 3rd child and the stroller is still going strong nothing wrong with it we are hard on this little stroller too it goes to the beach and out on the sand all summer it s rolling around bush gardens and other local theme parks day in and day out we have taken it down nature trails you can spin it around backwards and tackle big curbs and even go up stairs you decend stairs forward by popping the front wheel up off the ground and rolling just the back wheels down the stairs like you would with a hand truck back in 2007 2008 babies r us and other major retailers did not carry this brand or model i shopped for weeks testing each stroller and scrutinizing ever detail i would pretend to be my wife running to her car in am emergency scooping the baby up in one arm and flinging the stroller into the trunk of the car and see how the stroller performed the store employees thought i was crazy every stroller failed miserably until i found the city mini and i fell instantly in love this stroller is the wisest purchase that i ever made in my entire life i am a raving fan these days when i m out about and i see a young couple with their first little baby usually overdressed baby and over stressed parents in a city mini i always say hi and congratulate them on their stroller i encourage them that what ever life and their new little bundle of joy happen to throw at them they the city mini can handle i know smart parents when i see them because they re pushing a city mini i feel like we are in a special little club because we know the secret of what makes an awesome stroller light weight one hand maneuverability stupid easy fold up impeccable durability versatility great colors good looks etc all you parents to be make the smart choice from the beginning all you poor souls that didn t realize how important this decision was the first time around go ahead and make up for it now by choosing the unstoppable city mini this will be the last strollers you ever need unless you don t space your babies at least 2 5 years apart and then you will need the double city mini i wish i could post a pick of my almost 8 year old city mini but my 8 month old daughter is riding in it at busch gardens tampa right now and i m home writing this review good luck in your search god bless your family the smart choice from the beginning all you poor souls that didn t realize how important this decision was the first time around go ahead and make up for it now by choosing the unstoppable city mini this will be the last strollers you ever need unless you don t space your babies at least 2 5 years apart and then you will need the double city mini i wish i could post a pick of my almost 8 year old city mini but my 8 month old daughter is riding in it at busch gardens tampa right now and i m home writing this review good luck in your search god bless your family 
5 5 very nice way to stay close to your baby great for zoo outings ect 
5 5 the only one that fit and worked as designed no spurts of pee pee outside the ring 
5 5 i have the britax b ready and love it but it s wayyyy too heavy and i finally had enough so my search began for a lightweight stroller it was between this city lite and the chicco liteway i m so glad i chose this stroller it s lightweight compared to my britax at 15 pounds and so easy to open close it swivels nice rides smooth only pain is the dang buckles which i can live with so far i m very happy with this purchase 
5 5 this is the third one i have bought one for each kid and it is my favorite model of the three 
5 5 so comfy easy to use durable nice and thick these are so much better than using a blanket 
5 5 love these
5 5 perfect for holding hair ribbons and small items
5 5 i bought this to use to wash small toys in it works perfectly to hold the toys in place but still get them clean and sanitized 
5 5 for moms who baby wear this is a great product our son is constantly on us we have used so many carriers with him and this is by far the best carrier we use the 360 every day i wish i could compare the 360 to the original for you but when we were deciding between the two we decided on the 360 because we wanted the front carry option since our son is a wiggler you still have all the positions the original carrier offers we live the hip carry he is so comfortable in the carrier the first time we put him in it he fell right to sleep we will make a video soon comparing the 360 to our other carriers 
5 4 i have owned this seat for about 9 months now and decided to write a review because our nanny just totaled her car with our 18 month old daughter in this seat let me just say that our daughter came away from the accident without a scratch apart from some minor bruises from the straps around her legs and i truly believe this seat has everything to do with that first of all my daughter is big tall for her age 28 lbs 34 in and this was one of the few seats that can be rear facing up to 40 lbs this i have come to find is the absolute safest way to have your child in an accident and i m so glad in retrospect she was not forward facing in this crash we also had this seat placed in the middle of the back seat again safest place in the car if the worst should happen we have found it easy quick to get her in out if this seat despite it being in the middle second the side head supports were also a key factor in her safety from this crash as it protected her from the side airbags that deployed as well as prevented her head from josteling around too much we bought this seat on the recommendation of a friend who spent hours researching car seats i was a bit put off by the price at first but upon doing my own review of competing seats this one did seem a cut above the rest mainly because it could stay rear facing up to 40 lbs first of all this seat was very easy to install and easily transferred from car to car and has a sturdy design the fabric is durable and is easily cleaned my daughter is comfortable in this seat even on long trips my only complaint is that she does sweat a lot in it while in long trips so i dress her accordingly overall i think this seat is worth the money and i m buying another one now for baby 2 on the way 
4 1 i have had issues with the stroller shaking when i jog with it since i bought it and even though they have replaced the frame and wheels i am still having the issue 
5 4 cute but the hat had no ribbons and it was nylon sunglasses are very nice 
5 5 i had this bassinet with my first son and we hated it at first because it would only work for 10 seconds or so and my son would not lay in it what so ever we were so aggravated with it and so tired lol after two days of having it i thought maybe it was put together with bad batteries my fil put it together so i flipped it over and noticed it was still on 34 demo 34 i switched it to normal mode and it worked like a dream i laid our newborn down in it as a 34 last try and i m trashing this thing 34 turned the rocker on and he was loving it my husband and i were so thankful to find that switch and have our newborn sleeping peacefully i got rid of it after our first because the part they lay in became slanted and i didn t feel safe putting another baby in it i don t think they re really built to last that long anyway i just reordered this for our son who is due in these next few weeks and i am so excited about receiving this i hope he loves it as much as his brother a little about the product itself it rocks side to side and has a turn knob to control fast or slow rocking the music is soothing from what i remember we really only used one sound and it was the 34 nature 34 sound has storage on bottom i personally always forgot about this but could be helpful if you are moving it room to room to help carry whatever you need to take with you design was nice in my opinion i feel as though it could be used for either gender only con was they aren t built to last more than one child my personal experience and opinion but they re priced reasonably so i don t have a problem rebuying 
5 4 these wipes are a little silly but they taste good and they do in fact cleanse the mouth 
5 5 my 1yr old baby girl loves them 
5 5 i love this giraffe every child that i gift one to absolutely loves it 
5 5 my daughter is 4 5 months old and we just pulled this toy out for her to play with she loves it the lights really capture her attention and she gets very excited at the music the songs are much less annoying than most baby toys and there are enough of them that it takes a while before you hear the same one twice we use this when she s laying on her back sometime but it s best at tummy time or when she s sitting up on her back and sitting up she loves to reach for it while we move it around on her tummy we use it to encourage her to track side to side and up and down she lifts her head up really far and looks up quite high to follow it its a little heavy for her to hold on her own still but i expect we will get great mileage out of this toy as she grows happy i have 2 had thought about giving one away but will keep the second one so we have one to keep in the diaper bag for going out and one to keep at home to play with 
5 5 my mom bought me this wipes warmer because my newborn cried during diaper changes i didn t get it out of the box or set it up for a month because my baby stopped crying during changes the thing is way wider than a regular box of wipes and i really didn t think it was necessary i finally set it up today and i m so glad i did i don t know why i waited so long i can get through a diaper change without fully waking up my baby now what a lifesaver until this morning i was warming wipes in my hands or sticking them on my stomach if you are like i was and are thinking wipes warmers are a silly luxury try sticking a wipe on your stomach at 4am they re freaking cold the wipes don t seem to heat uniformly but they re still warm and yes they do lose some of the heat when you take them out of the container but they re still warm enough to not shock your little baby s bum totally worth the extra space it takes up oh mine also came with a little plastic container filled with a roll of green baggies and a refill of the baggies there was no description of these anywhere so i can only assume they re for the diaper bag to contain dirty diapers and wipes but i could be totally wrong that s just how i ve decided to use them 
5 5 love them
5 5 this has been very comforting to us in trying to avoid an accident with our 1 5 year old we put this on our basement door to prevent her from getting access to the stairs will be purchasing more 
5 5 bought this for my son s nursery and i m very happy with the purchase the quality of the paper and the print is very high to install it all i had to do was soak it for a few seconds in water take it in the bedroom and press it into place where i wanted it i do recommend having a helper with this because it made it made it much easier to put into place with help to support it s weight after it was in place i only had to wipe it over a few times with a wet rag to smooth out the bumps though i ve painted hung drywall and done alot of dyi projects over the years this was my 1st time ever attempting wall border it was really no problem at all as long as you have a little bit of common sense everyone who has come to my house and seen the nursery has really complimented the character this border added it s a little pricey at 17 per roll i needed 3 but it s well worth it for my son and with the quality i know this border is going to stay right where it is and look good until i decide it s time to take it back again someday overall worth the money and work to install 
5 5 best sippy cup
5 5 works great 
5 5 we ve had this for a year now can t beat the price great sound it s still going strong we love it another monitor would be nice but we didn t really need two if the unit isn t connecting with the base it has a really loud alarm that is fixed by turning it off and back on like rebooting but i usually turn this off during the day when i m at work so it s no big deal 
5 4 we like it so much we bought two surelatch technology is worth the extra we originally purchased the lx edition very difficult to get a secure fit in the car this car seat installs quickly and easily a huge benefit to this mom who frequently takes the car seat in and out for work peace of mind that it is installed securely material is durable not as bad as many make it seem to take the cover off to wash my daughter got sick in hers in the first week and it washed nicely she is very comfortable in the rear facing position sleeps easily though her head does fall forward sometimes everyone else in the car has space too we have a new jeep cherokee not the biggest suv but my husband and i have ample leg room on the driver and passenger side alike we can recline the passenger seat back for longer car rides most importantly exceeds safety standards and made in the usa designed in our home state ohio 
1 1 bad really bad product very disappointed please people do not buy this thing 5 stars 
5 5 these replacement pieces are exactly the same as the ones that come with the ameda unit in the image they appeared solid white to me but when they arrived i was pleasantly surprised to find they are clear and appear to be exactly like the ones that came with the machine getting these as a back up the first set i eventually ripped through when i used a small bottle brush to wash it the metal end gradually tore the plastic enough that it stopped working now i just use the corner of a contoured dish sponge and it works just fine 
5 5 great teether and the way it twists around makes it more entertaining for its purpose 
1 1 the description stated this gate would expand to 6 feet but no matter what i did i couldn t get it do that out of the box it appeared that it would be easy to assemble but it wasn t you have to extend both rods simultaneously or it will get too snug on one side preventing you from extending the rod on the other side i ended up bending a rod just trying to assemble it i sent it back 
5 5 i m very happy with this organizer it is a perfect size and looks exactly like it is pictured very well made the only thing that surprised me since i am used to very fast shipping and deliveries with amazon prime is that it took about 3 weeks to receive but the chinese return address explains that 
5 1 there are many reasons why we enjoyed this product in the short term and one very important reason why we don t in the long term the negative which is a big safety issue needs to come first the feet of the wubbanub are weighted with bean bag beans our still quite young baby loves to chew on all parts of the animal not just the paci and the seams are not tightly sewn two feet have opened up as another poster noted the beans are contained within a mesh compartment inside the animal feet but get through the plush and you re right up next to that i ve sewed up one of the frayed feet but there is little fabric at the seam to allow safe or easy repair particularly now that our baby has the beginnings of two teeth which i might add came after the seams sprang not before i am reluctant to leave the wubbanub alone with her in her swing or car seat lest she gnaw into the beans by mistake which could be disastrous we re going to have to retire this toy the obvious safety issues at stake here make any follow up comments superfluous it s non negotiable in my book but i will allow that this is disappointing because our baby loved her wubbanub and spent a lot of time learning to manipulate it it was her very first toy in terms of something she interacted with and i think it actually helped her development in a number of ways she d probably like to keep it around for a while but i just can t do it on these terms i hope a redesign might come up with some other way of weighting the feet 
4 4 this is a very large and sturdy product but only to be used for a permanent spot because it is difficult to install 
5 4 i bought this for my youngest grandson s christening it is very nice some of the reviews indicate that the nice silver finish does not hold up i am optimistic at this point 
5 5 purchased for a shower gift since it was on their registry it is high quality materials and large enough pieces that you don t need to worry about the parts being too small and a choking hazard the expectant mom was very pleased with the teething necklace and they make great gifts the necklace itself was nicely made and you can see the necklace isn t intended to be worn as jewelry for the mom but it s also nice enough that you aren t feel awkward wearing it while the baby chews on it 
5 5 great value get so much for the price i don t notice a difference from the medela ones 
1 1 this is a terrible product for a couple different reasons first it can e so folded in the plastic bag that my husband could not shake it correctly and it stayed like an oval shape no matter what we did also the sides seem like the baby could easily push their face against and suffocate the material is not breathable and thick this product seems unsafe to me i will be giving it to my toddler for her plastic baby dolls 
5 5 it s really god
5 5 i love that these are so cheap and easy to order they fit my medela pump in style advanced and they re good quality i find that i have a problem with getting milk in pump tubing no matter the brand and once that happens then it will continue to happen even if you clean them out so it s easier for me to just have extra tubing on hand once they get milk in them a few times i just change them out i also like having a second set to use when i m cleaning out one set since they take a bit to dry 
5 5 we use this in our strolller and it is great we just leave it in there all the time so we don t have to worry about bringing a blanket or having a blanket fall on the ground when it s warm we just tuck the top of the cover under our baby s feet it s a wonderful product 
2 2 so they didn t come with instruction so i had a hard time turning them on until i realized they turn on in water after my first use i wasn t able to them then of either wish led to them burning out and even rusting from inside because i guess the water leaked in they size look pretty for a short time and they are cute and tiny but over all annoying let down 
1 2 i purchased this monitor off my own registry since it was expensive and no one opted to buy it for us we didn t open it until 3 months later when our baby slept in the nursery rather than in a bassinet beside our bed so the return date had unfortunately passed although the range and night vision is adequate even on the lowest volume setting the background feedback noise is so loud it is impossible to sleep with it on it makes that high pitched annoying sound florescent lights often make in addition the screen does not automatically come on when noise activates it so i have to fumble in the dark to press a button to view the baby my husband found a great deal on another monitor so we ve used that one instead and i m stuck with this expensive purchase that we don t use 
4 1 came in on time that equals one star receiving it shattered upon arrival no star i m hoping i can gorilla glue this thing together otherwise i have to go out and buy an expensive one 
5 5 perfect 
4 4 this seat seems fine although my daughter is still in the early stages of potty training it does not fit on a contoured elongated toilet seat circa 1999 but it does fit on a non contoured toilet seat circa 2014 the 34 locking 34 mechanism doesn t really lock but the seat stays in place well with for an active 32 pound child the plastic is a hard plastic my daughter doesn t seem to mind but her legs do get red if she sits for several minutes the handles on the side do seem to add some stability for her i can t comment on the splash guard or cleaning since our seat has been used only for sitting thus far 
5 5 bought this for my 2 year old and he loves it takes it everywhere great little monkey nice size just bought a second one for school great monkey
5 5 i used bibbity bibs at every feeding until my daughter was two the catch pocket does a nice job and the neck opening has three different slots to fit a range of sizes the bibs went through the dishwasher with no signs of wear and they roll up nicely for travel the pocket also serves as a bowl for cheerios and other finger foods a flight attendant saw my daughter eating cheerios from her bib pocket and declared she was going to buy a bibbity for her grandson i only stopped using these bibs because they are now too short to cover my daughter s shirt this isn t really a design flaw had they been longer the catch pocket would have been below the high chair tray when my daughter was younger for comparison i also purchased the bjorn bib and an ikea pocket bib the hard plastic on those was uncomfortable around my daughter s neck and did not sit well against the high chair tray 
5 3 the gate is well made and easy to install securely the only drawback is that it is higher than most baby gates and my wife can t get over without removal 
5 5 we used the soothie pacifiers until my daughter had her tongue and lip tie released at 8 weeks after that procedure she just didn t like any pacifiers any more i ve tried 5 different types and she hates them all sounds like a dream but sometimes it s nice to have something that soothes her other than breastfeeding i read an article on these pacis and immediately ordered a set yes i received the blue and red pacis instead of the more girly ones but i don t care they re pefect she loves them at 6 months when we re already dealing with sleep regression issues and a new tooth and one more on the way i m thrilled that these provide comfort i m ordering two more sets now so we re not without them also i can t seem to find these in local stores they have the oval ones but they re not the orthodontic ones amazon is the only place i can find these softflex ortho pacis for 6 month olds :(
5 5 very goodproduct all seven pieces just as described in photos nice big box arrived intact very nice quality of fabric and high quality teddy bear very soft overall good value for money 
5 5 got as a gift for a mom to be and she loved it came in retail packaging and looks like the real deal not sure why other reviews said it was knock off 
5 5 beermo bottle pacifier mustaches 6 pack can not go into detail but the shenanigans where are ten fold ;)
5 5 i am weaning my 10 month old and these are the only bottles she will accept they are easy for her to hold as the bottom is larger and textured which prevents her hands from sliding down the nipple has a tapered shape and soft texture which has has really helped with the transition not to mention easy to clean wide enough to wash by hand we have had success with warming the bottle and replacing one feeding at a time also using the slowest flow nipple that comes with this set after a week she is now holding the bottle herself and drinking it happily there s been no issues switching between bottles during the day and breast at night as a sidenote the mam pacifiers are amazing as well the texture is soft like skin not slick like other pacifiers they were my first daughters favorite and my favorite because other kinds blocked her nostrils she was tiny 
5 5 my son loves these not a fan of the chicco or smoothies but loves these 
5 5 great 
5 5 we love these pacis only paci my daughter likes 
4 5 nice product although like other reviewers i received pink and purple for my little boy the package in the product image looks red but it s really pink i was aware colors may vary but i was hoping they d at least be gender neutral 
5 5 my son loves the mam nipples and these are super cute 
5 3 color quality is not as vivid as in pic
5 3 baby never liked this one small enough to leave dog stomach but big enough to get stuck bad news
5 5 so much easier for them and you when they are still to young to hold on to things my son loves both of his 
5 5 love this wubbanub
5 5 love em 
5 5 of all the pacifiers i bought my daughter only liked this one it s also very easy to wash just throw it in the washer 
5 5 loved giving this gift box it is really great as a baby shower gift and packaged well the blanket is extra soft as well as the teddy bear looks just like the pics my friend said she uses all the products and are all very useful great for those who don t have the time to run to the store and select each item very good value for money always a bit worried to buy online but this was bingo 
5 4 i like the avent paci s and the little handle on them these don t glow in the dark for very long maybe a couple of hours 
5 5 great product 
5 5 great product 
5 5 this is great it holds 2 of your daughter s pacifiers and fits great in my diaper bag or if i need to throw it in my purse it also has a snap on the strap so you can attach it to your bag for easy access it stays closed well and we have not had issues with it opening unexpectedly at all 
5 5 sent this as a 34 gonna be a new mommy 34 gift she said it is beautiful would recommend for someone you are not sure what to get for them but want to send something that will be treasured forever 
5 5 excelente
5 5 we ve tried a lot of pacifiers these are the one my son loves he is now 8 months and still likes em 
5 5 my granddaughter loves these 
5 5 love these because at night they glow in the dark when the baby wakes up screaming and sometimes he can find it himself because it glows 
5 5 nice seller nice item 
2 3 my baby is barely getting used to it 
5 4 received it in the time alloted would recommend to friends 
5 5 our baby likes these 
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers they are lightweight and i like that they are one piece there is no hard plastic that can shatter just one soft piece 
5 1 my baby will accept tommy tippy dr browns and avent bottles she hates these and refuses to use them the nipples are oddly hard and inflexible 
5 5 there awesome we have 3 different ones all great 
5 5 excellent
5 3 it worked great until my son chewed through the netting with his sharp front teeth 
5 4 my newborn likes these best out of the ones we ve tried this shape of nipple is best for breastfeeding babies since they are rounded on both sides rather than the type that are angled on one side which the lactation consultant told me never to use because they will make baby used to using certain muscles in his mouth and will create an improper latch habit while nursing the only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars is that the nipples are a little long for small babies and mine sometimes gags on it 
5 3 u really have to get it in the light to get it to glow but these are my babies favortie pacificers also the bottle warmer by avent is awesome takes a beating
5 5 super fast shipping and product as described
5 5 excellent
5 5 great product 
5 5 ive been a cowboys fan the moment i was born in 92 my dad is a die hard fan so it s only right that i set my daughter on the right track too the product is beautiful i will deff be buying from this seller again thank u so much
5 5 excellent
3 4 my son is 18 weeks old and has never really liked sucking on a pacifier but is constantly looking for something to chew on i gave him an avent soothie pacifier in the 3 month size and he enjoys chewing on it but doesn t suck on it i purchased a wubbanub for him to use and he does really enjoy playing with it again he doesn t really suck on it like you imagine a baby using a pacifier but he chews on the base of the pacifier and also the stuffed animal legs but the pacifier attached to the stuffed animal is much softer than the regular avent soothie he seems to enjoy chewing on the plain soothie better but the animal parts keep him occupied for a while if wubbanub gave an option for a more firm pacifier i would definitely buy that one 
5 5 great set and baby loves them 
5 5 this was a little treasure i stuck into the pocket on the zebra and hot pink diaper bag i found the mother to be was thrilled 
5 5 son loves it 
5 5 my son absolutely loves it 
5 5 my son received one of these in the hospital and he consistently loves this brand 
5 5 this thing changed my baby s sleeping life he could finally get back to sleep on his own in his bed or in his car seat once i gave him this wubbanub that he could easily find and get to his mouth on his own 
5 5 my son never really used a pacifier but he loves to use these as teething toys because they are easy for him to hold and manipulate 
5 1 its a very bad product has a strange smell at beginning and it leave marks over my baby s mouse cause shutter is designed very tight
5 5 my grandson loves this binky 
4 3 the nipple is easy to clean and colors are nice but the problem with it is the plastic part is flat it falls out very easily i was expecting a more natural shape that hugs the child s mouth it would also be nice to have a right side up and upside down the nipple is the same both ways but one way the plastics part pushes against the child s nose everything else was good 
5 5 keeps paci s in tight 
5 5 perfect
5 5 i love these we had a long plane trip and had these on hand easy to use 
5 5 best thing ever invented op
5 5 great bottles and the gift set is a good deal if you compare prices at any store that sells them 
5 5 my daughter absolutely loves her wubbanub i introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth she would get so frustrated and angry while the wubbanub didn t solve all of our issues it certainly helped my daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn t really fond of pacifiers but she absolutely adores her wubbanub tiger now that she s older 4 months she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it she honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her we forgot it one day and well let s just say that wasn t a good day for anyone i think it s adorable that it gives her both something to suck on and sometimes gnaw on as well as comfort with the stuffed animal i ll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth we ll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed ha to clean it i usually just wipe off the pacifier since she takes it to daycare i ll handwash the tiger in dapple soap at least once every week or so and then hang it to dry 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 we are on giraffe 2 after a year of heavy use and many washes the original 34 g 34 tore away from the paci this is a great size for even the littlest of hands and my son loves to pull on all of the appendages we also had a puppy one but my son would always reach for this one first 
5 5 my baby is 9 months old and has had these since birth they hold up well they are easy to clean easy to find because the animals are more viable than a bouncy little binky very cute but the dog got this one the day it made it to us so we are sad 
3 3 annoying that there is no loop to hold onto constantly falling out of babies mouth onto the ground yeah i could get a paci clip but i haven t yet 
5 3 does the job
1 2 these pacifiers didn t work for us unfortunately our breastfed baby would not accept these pacifiers and repeatedly spat them out we had better luck with nuk pacifiers which have a nipple with a flattened bottom these may work better for bottle fed babies who are accustomed to this nipple shape 
5 5 adorable design i was worried the glow in the dark feature would distract my baby it did not and as a bonus it made it much easier to find his paci in the middle of the night after he had dropped thrown it 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my son would take and we now own so many of them they are light and easy for newborns and young babies to hold onto but haven t caused any nipple confusion the design is really thoughtful and we d recommend this to any new parent although each kid is different these seem to be really especially made for the younger ones 
5 5 great product had for months now with no issues or flaws 
5 5 they are good but m baby just would not take this paci
5 5 one of my baby s favorite pacifier really cute the shape makes it really easy for baby to hold the material is easy to maintain clean love this paci 
5 5 good 
5 5 thank you very much everything as expected
5 2 one pacifier was received with a hole in the center of it had to throw it away make sure to check these pacifiers good one had a hole the other one was fine my lo was not happy with the holy one lol 
5 4 this was a shower gift on her registry she received two others like it but with different animals 
5 3 it was for a baby shower and when she opened it she just loved thanks
5 5 cutest pacifier ever 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my twins use 
5 4 my daughter absolutely loves these and won t take any other type of pacifier it needs to be the hello kitty one
3 1 the catopiller is stiff and heavier then some of the other wubbanubs my twins hated it very cute but both babies can t keep in mouth like the soft blue puppy :(
5 5 since the day he was born my son has refused to use any pacifier that doesn t have a stuffed animal attached to it he now has several wubbanubs and loves them all but the dragon is my and now his personal favorite it s pretty bad ass walking around with a baby who s got a dragon hanging from his mouth :)
5 5 my son is fed via a combination of breastfeeding and pumped milk we ve tried a lot of bottles and he prefers the mams over everything else for him the nipples on dr browns and born free are too long he hated the avent naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch he is ok with nuks but he prefers the mams i think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him it is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples they say it mimics the breast that isn t our issue as i use a nipple shield he also seems to have less gas due to the venting system that all said it is true that these can leak from the base if you don t assemble them correctly it has happened to me i know now to double check the base before i pour milk in in addition the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water you ll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding since the plastic is fairly thick on these i just heat up the milk in a medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed 
5 5 love this item
2 2 baby didn t take it 
5 5 since the day he was born my son has refused to suck on a pacifier unless it has a stuffed animal attached to it wubbanub is the absolute best and this monkey is very cute i highly recommend buying a few different nubs because your child won t want anything else 
5 5 my grandson loves his wubbanub he is able to keep this pinky in his mouth while the others would just pop right out he gets soon excited when he sees his wubby 
4 5 but it came with a little hole that i ended up sewing
5 5 great pacifier it is our son s favorite brand 
5 5 this actually stays in the baby s mouth quite well and because of it s size it stays on the baby s chest and off the floor when he does flip it out of his mouth not to mention how cute it is and the nipple part is compatible for the needs of a new born because it is more nipple shaped i was grateful to be able to use it for my newborn 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my one month old son will take it s spendy for a pacifier but worth it and it s adorable 
5 4 this gave us a modest amount of fun but i won t trip on my feet for it 
5 5 so cute
1 1 why put up a picture of boy pacifiers if it s not going to be boy pacifiers 
5 5 the baby was very happy with her new pacifier 
5 5 we lost one of these and this is a replacement my granddaughter loves it 
4 4 i really like it however my daughters mouth is very shallow so the nipple is too long and makes her gag when she is a bit bigger she will probably take to it more 
5 5 i tried making my own wubbanub type pacifier bear from a little plush toy and a spare pacifier my daughter will use it in a pinch but clearly prefers the brand wubbanub pink bear she loves the bear body is so soft and squishy she also likes to play with the soft tag i think when she weans off the pacifier she will want to keep the bear part as a lovey this bear makes it so easy to find the pacifier especially in a car seat the only thing is that it is a little harder to clean than a traditional pacifier that can be run through a sterilizer or through the dishwasher i boil some water add a few drops of antibacterial essential oil like lavender and dip the pacifier end in to soak for a few minutes to clean the bear part i occasionally run the entire item through the laundry washer in a delicates bag and let air dry 
5 5 good
5 5 baby loves it especially at night or morning when she s looking for her binky easy to find and grasp for babies 
5 5 depending on which pacifiers i choose i can actually put 2 in here very convenient i like that i can clip it onto the stroller 
5 5 excellent 
5 5 baby s favorite and he can hold it 
5 5 love it 
5 5 perfect
5 5 cute
3 2 my daughter didn t care for this style of binky the hard plastic left marks on her face 
1 2 let s talk about the form of the gumdrop nipple itself i m a mother of 6 children nursed all of them our first child first used a pacifier avent silicone flatter nipple 10 years ago and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night i swore them off our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them after receiving an orange newborn gumdrop from the hospital out of desperation for a few moment s peace i purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3 months from amazon after the first week i noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son s mouth when he would relax i could never hold him one handed while doing chores my other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place also during suction he would have to suck really hard making loud sucking noises as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth this caused him to swallow a lot of air which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined dozy position to be burped also his lips always tucked inward not outward like they do on the breast putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1 startle himself awake with the sucking noise air swallowing gas or 2 the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn t tired enough to overcome the reflex thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small i ordered the 3 month size and noticed hardly any difference the silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3 month paci but there is no difference in nipple length or width see pictures after thinking about it some more it occurred to me that the gumdrop nipple doesn t mimic the human nipple in any way what so ever my 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first comes with the territory my newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied he also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple which flattens considerably during breastfeeding the gumdrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes my nipple remains flat stuck in the suction of the baby when my son relaxes tonight 5 weeks later i finally broke down and bought a nuk since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple longer flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn t pop out of baby s mouth hasn t fallen out all day baby is sleeping soundly now i would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if first years is the same as hawaii medical my hospital paci has a 1 800 number stamped into it not 34 first years 34 like the hawaii medical gumdrops i received from amazon as you ll see in the photos the hospital paci has a 34 matte 34 finish which probably feels rougher more like a human nipple and the first years is shiny and smooth photo left to right orange newborn gumdrop green 3 months first years gumdrop blue nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple which flattens considerably during breastfeeding the gumdrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes my nipple remains flat stuck in the suction of the baby when my son relaxes tonight 5 weeks later i finally broke down and bought a nuk since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple longer flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn t pop out of baby s mouth hasn t fallen out all day baby is sleeping soundly now i would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if first years is the same as hawaii medical my hospital paci has a 1 800 number stamped into it not 34 first years 34 like the hawaii medical gumdrops i received from amazon as you ll see in the photos the hospital paci has a 34 matte 34 finish which probably feels rougher more like a human nipple and the first years is shiny and smooth photo left to right orange newborn gumdrop green 3 months first years gumdrop blue nuk
5 5 pefrect
5 3 so far my 4 month old son does not like these they are much thicker than the 0 month ones and the nipple is super strong probably so that teething babies can chew on them i will give an update when he s teething 
1 2 was awesome for about 5 months then the battery life was gone didn t charge or hold a charge would turn off immediately after unplugging it always has to be plugged in which renders it pointless for any activity other than laying in bed yourself buy a cheaper one if thats all you re looking to do if you wanna be more active during naps or after an 8pm bedtime don t buy this one at all 
3 1 i received it fast but it doesn t seem to be working absolutely nothing seems to really be working actually i also feel that it was to tight around my sons neck i didn t feel it was safe 
5 5 great bibs super soft very trendy 
1 1 not what expected pictures above are not the real product they are not foam cheap material
5 3 made a huge mistake i thought this was going to work for the home too i was sooooooooooooo wrong i bought the adapters 7 they just recharge so i m stuck until i find a guy that has a car 
5 5 good carseat 
5 5 this was just what i needed for my grandbaby easy to assemble and fold down but imposible to put back in it s bag otherwise it is perfect 
5 3 i bought this for my grandson for our car it s is extremely light weight compared to a more expensive one my daughter has unless you fit it permanently with the hook system then it wobbles around somewhat i wish i had bought a better one 
1 1 leaks after 3 months
5 5 really awesome for any full sized adjustable headrest didn t work on the middle seat of my honda van the headrest was too small but i installed it on the side seat the seat beside where the car seat is installed i do need to take it down if someone is sitting there but it is quick and easy to install my 1 year old likes to look in the mirror and see me and it is plenty big i can see her entire seat easily no distortions and it isn t too small it will shake a tad when driving but my main objective is to see if she was in distress and i can see well enough the angle adjusts well and stays put much better than other mirror options i have tried 
5 3 all of the parts don t exactly fit together so there isn t a clean seal anywhere middle or top for odor to not seep out of 
5 5 these letter numbers are great my two year played with them for the first time yesterday in the shower they stick easily on both glass and porcelain on both sides so he could easily put them wherever he wanted using either side the bag is great and keeps the letters from ending up all over the place my only minor complaint is that the draw string closes pretty easily and was hard for my toddler to get the letters in the bag without some help i don t know that there is anything that can be done about that and in the end it s extremely minor all in all some great toys can t wait to work on spelling and letter recognition with him in the bath 
5 5 easy to manage and control love the color 
5 5 nice storage bottles for breast milk i use them every day 
5 5 yay finally something that worked for us to put a gate up at bottom of stairs 
5 4 my 6 month old has been teething for the last 2 months he s never taken a pacifier or bottle and doesn t play with any of different teething rings he has available he does however chew on his fingers and will chew on my knuckles this cactus thing though is awesome he loves it there s several different options he can chew from it hasn t replaces his fingers but my knuckles get a break the price was worth it but i know each kid likes different things i m just glad i found something he likes for his teething only downside is that hairs stick to it because it s silicone 
5 5 best cups ever not only are they made from recycled milk bottles yay they re cute and they are the only sippy cups i have that i truly trust not to leak even if they re left upside down or on their side in my bag i have tried them all seriously they all leak many won t leak most of the time but as soon as something touches the spout they will these are perfect as long as you put the interior piece on correctly it stays on and i have been using the same 3 cups with my 2 kids for over 3 years and they are still working as well as day one highly recommend i will say that family members who try and put the inner piece in sometimes put it on backwards and no water comes out but it is easily fixed and neither me nor my husband have ever had a problem confusing the direction it should go 
5 5 my baby s favorite toy 
5 5 these washcloths were purchased for adult use i was originally looking for a 100 cotton washcloth to replace some worn ones i have after reading some of the reviews i decided to order a pack of the brooklyn bamboo baby washcloths when i received the shipment unfortunately i had a rough place on my finger that snagged and pulled the threads on one of the washcloths i went ahead and placed all of the washcloths in the washer and dryer so that my husband and i could use them that night when i took them out of the dryer the snagged place was not even noticeable the washcloths were very soft i was able to soap up the washcloth for my shower without having to continue re soaping the washcloth as i had previously had to do with the old washcloths this turned out to be a side benefit for saving soap my husband and i are both very satisfied with the purchase 
5 5 absolutely beautiful love it 
4 4 it works but my infant hates it maybe she ll appreciate it when she s a bit older 
5 3 great fit with no gaps all around 
5 4 good product my baby love his little dogfor me that like to sterilize everything in hot water is kind of difficult because the dog comes attached to the pacifier
5 5 awesome 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 item was as pictured the pacifier pack with birds on it 
5 5 very impressed 
5 5 these are the greatest binkys ever my first refused any other kind but these and yes i do believe that it s all baby preference but they are easy to find come in many colors which js awesome bc my older one has transitioned to the blue super soothie for older babies tougher rubber for teeth easy to wash they work with all binky leashes and i cannot say enough good things about these especially when they keep my kids happy 
5 5 our son loved this around 3 months i would highly recommend it 
5 5 amazing
5 4 love only problem is cleaning the pacifier is nearly impossible without getting the stuffed animal wet 
5 5 my son loves these pacifier s 
5 5 my son loves these 
5 5 love works well as a weighted pacifier for my daughter it s harder for her to lose it out of her mouth 
5 5 my nephew loves it 
1 1 i was extremely disappointed when these arrived it did say colors may vary but they should stick to gender neutral colors i ordered these for my son and when they arrived they were both pink pacifiers very dissapointing 
5 5 different babies like different pacifiers so if these didn t work for some it doesn t mean they won t work for you that being said my baby isn t super picky about his pacifier he will suck on avents chiccos and these both orthopedic and natural shaped but these are by far his favorite i think he prefers the natural shape but i also love these because they are flexible no hard plastic which sometimes digs into his cheeks with others and they are also just one formed piece which is safer no risk of the nipple coming off the plastic handle 
5 5 excelent quality
5 5 was what we used when our daughter was newborn up to 3 months then transitioned her to nuk brand with the avent soothies we did not have nipple confusion she did have a hard time keeping it in her mouth though so they seem slightly heavy 
5 5 we are total fans of this pacifier things we love about it the pacifier stays put in the baby s mouth longer it s easy for the baby to grab it doesn t fall as often it s cute the baby can suck on the pacifier or the doll and it s easy to find we is easy to wash everyday we wash it with soap and water then we have the paci part sit in a bowl of hot boiling water once in a while i put it in a basket and put it in the wash we got two as a baby shower gift and bought another one just in case 
5 5 good
5 5 we love wubbanubs the only thing i don t like about it is after your child grows out of this stage of paci you can t switch it out and you can t detach the pacifier to wash the stuffed animal part in the washer its kind of sad throwing it away 
5 5 i think our 2 month old is starting to hug this cute guy when she is soothing herself it also makes for some sweet pictures with two sets of big eyes 
5 5 this is a great product in fact i ordered another one right after
5 5 the product came sooner than expected this is good because the day after i was to give it to my sister it was exactly as pictured the colors were vibrant the packaging was perfect the nipple was intact no tears or odd lumps it didn t have any sharp edges that could harm the baby i can t wait to see what the baby looks like using this i will most likely be buying from this seller again in the future 
5 5 it is great 
5 5 love this bought this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old and now she can easily find her binky at night without fully waking up or waking me up she s 10 months now and she brings it everywhere 
5 5 every newborn gets one of these as a gift from me as they become their favorite 
4 4 i was hoping my newborn would like these they are a little too big for a 2 week old but definitely saving to try at a later time i sanitized the best i could without getting them too hot boiling is not a good idea from what i read from previous buyers she didn t seem to like the taste but then again she is 2 weeks old and only likes food in her mouth try are exactly what i ordered so i gave 4 stars just a little too big for newborns it covers her nose :)
5 1 there s a dolphin picture on the redskins label
5 5 best thing ever so helpful to have and keep track of the binks 
5 5 these are some great pacifiers our daughter is teething these will last a week before showing signs of wear versus other brands that she has wore out in two days or less 
5 5 these are the only ones my daughters will use i ve boughten atleast 10 packages because we are always losing them they are amazing especially with the clips i always have a couple spares in te diaper bag true bed and my beside table highly recommend
5 5 daughter loves them 
5 4 great and durable design on button will wear off after some time but rest of the product is quality have bought multiple versions and would recommend 
5 5 as nicu nurse i can heartily recommend the wubbanubs as a grandmother i even more heartily recommend one is not enough
5 5 my 2 month old absolutely loves this he cuddles with it whether or not he s using the pacifier 
5 5 this is good my baby after very well
1 1 i expected something else but ended up with this disappointed
5 5 these apparently are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and keep in her mouth everything else she spits out even the silicone ones of the same brand wish there was more latex selection in mam brand 
5 5 although it doesn t close when dropped it closes after being dropped face down or if dropped on the side the nipple is safe but atleast beats the hassle of carrying the cover around 
5 5 mam is the only brand we use love them 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my daughter will take they are molded symmetrically so if she takes it out and puts it back in her mouth upside down it is still the same shape and she is still happy 
1 2 i love this brand however i thought i was getting blue for my son and i was sent pink ones very disappointed
4 4 they are nice my baby won t take them but i like them all the same 
5 5 lots of fun 
4 3 love this brand the only pacifier my daughter will take i was thrilled to find a glow in the dark version as we always seem to be patting around the mattress in the dark looking for it the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because the glow doesn t last very long it needs to 34 charge 34 in light at which time it is very bright however after a few minutes of being in the dark it no longer glows which is unhelpful at 3 a m 
5 4 i received my order for these today and they were not blue and green don t think my son in law will let my grandson use a pink nuk ha they are pink and green the baby does love this type of pacifier so i will keep the pink one at my house as a spare 
5 5 best pacifiers we ve found we ve bought 4 and will buy more slight curve fits well for sleeping babies 
5 5 great holding power one suction is applied handle will not move excellent
5 5 love this idea i have a 2 year old who is potty training this will be perfect for traveling and camping 
5 5 works like a charm great buy for traveling and keeping baby happy 
5 3 the dots are raised and might cause a person to slip 
4 3 nice colors but wish it was a little softer maybe it will as time goes on and it is washed over and over 
4 1 this item is not sturdy enough to transport my child in her car seat 
5 5 this butterfly was even prettier in person i think it s really gorgeous and the colors are perfect 
5 5 very nice great way to store baby s pacifier i bought it for my daughter in law and she liked it a lot it matched her diaper bag very well 
5 5 i bought this as a gift for someone who has a baby plus two other pre school age children the baby has had frequent respiratory infections since birth and i have to believe the nasal aspirator will be a welcome addition to their baby s care before mailing it to the parents i took it to work with me to show some of the ladies that i work with they were all impressed with the way it was made and the easy assembly easy to take apart for cleaning and the carry case it looks like a great product i just have not used it myself 
4 3 this monitor use to work very well my only original complaint and the reason for initial four stars iwas the battery life on the display see update below even with the video off and just using the audio the batter life was not great not horrible just not great we have a relatively large house 4000sf and have not had any issues with reception the only problem that we have noticed relating to reception of the receiver is around our wifi connected devices if i have the receiver to close to my ipad the receiver will beep telling me that it cannot find the camera if i moved the ipad one to two feet from the receiver display the problem goes away this problem was resolved see below one last point when you put this product in your basket amazon will tell you that other people also bought a power adapter for the camera you do not need to buy anything else with this product it comes with everything you need 1 22 15 update we swapped out our home router for 5 0 ghz router which solved the interference issues we were having with wifi connected devices unfortunately the battery has died and the base unit the monitor will not work unless plugged into the wall which would be fine if the electrical connection was not constantly failing we thought it was a bad ac adapter or cord but it turns out it s the receptacle on the monitor the spot where you plug the ac adapter into the monitor is loose so if you move the monitor or the cable the unit looses power we have tried everything including taping the power cable to the monitor so that the cable would not move or come loose but this only worked for a short period 
1 1 dryer sheets smell great in the box but leave no smell at all on clothes very disappointed and wish i didn t waste the money on 2 boxes your regular brand name dryer sheets work better that s these expensive ones don t waste your money 
5 5 great
5 5 my son loves this blanket 
4 4 i have a floppy seat cover and needed to get another cover for my mom to use while she is with my son i love both cart covers and the plus with this one is that it has tags for him to tinker with however it s unfortunately alot more cumbersome to put on the cart verses the floppy seat and it does not stay on as well or fit as snugly as the floppy seat 15 seconds with the floppy seat verses a minute with adjusting this one makes it a little more agitating to deal with but the material looks and feels a little softer in comparison to the floppy seat i do love the harness feature though and the thinner material will be alot more comfortable for my son when it starts to get alot warmer the floppy seat is quite a bit fluffier in comparison which could cause him to get too stuffy in the hotter months i wish it also came with a carrying bag like the floppy seats do but these are minor problems and i m still enjoying the cover so far 
5 4 this splatter sheild is fantastic for containing the mess and overspray while still allowing for the use of the sprayer at full power i didn t find the squeeze option to ring out enough water however and usually have to ring out the inserts by hand afterwards 
5 5 purchased this before our baby was born in fall 2013 despite mixed reviews after 17mos of use it is still in excellent shape and the lightweight feature makes changing sheets so much easier highly recommend 
1 1 doesn t fit any cart backs you constantly have to adjust the back and front and if baby leans forward it doesn t hold them properly because it doesn t fit the cart right 
1 1 by 2 month old could not use this after the first time because the milk came out so fast it gaged him and milk went all over him what a waste of money
3 4 easy to put together difficult but not impossible to install with one person could stand to be a but more sturdy
5 4 one bottle is only half full after 1 year 
5 5 my granddaughter loves the different colors of lights from this ladybug :)
5 5 worth every penny when you are changing the crib sheets 
4 4 i loved this fan and it looks really good in the kids room but i wish the light on it was a bit more elaborate like a three blub fixture or four it does light the room well though as it is not very big 
5 4 have bought a couple of these to add to our diaper bags so we have a convenient place to store the pacifiers we have found it holds all of the different pacifiers we have and will hold one plus the holder attachment we use to clip to the car seat easily sometimes difficult to open but would rather that be the case then it flipping open and dumping its contents regularly 
5 4 standard hospital style pacifier
5 5 both parents loved these the pink hat was a little big for a newborn but they like the carhartt pink 
3 2 really cute however i normally like these cause of the flexability between the animal and the pacifier part but this one didn t have much of a gap between the to so she can t control it well 
3 3 they are okay but i like the born free much better the hard plastic does not conform to my son s face and it doesn t stay in his mouth that well when washing soap and water get in the nipple and it s impossible to get all the water out so i m worried about mildew
5 5 mam pacifiers are fantastic i bought these thinking they glowed in the dark but they do not however i ended up keeping them because the colors are great 
5 5 my husband and i were so afraid to offer a pacifier given how hard i was working on establishing breastfeeding however our little girl has such a strong suck reflex and need for comfort that it was best for her this was the only brand that she would touch we tried five others and she spit them out the size is amazing for newborns she is 6 weeks and still uses it there has been no nipple confusion at all with this we are so grateful and highly recommend these 
2 2 plastic is too hard and flat sticks out too much on the sides 
5 5 i love these bottles for my grandbabies i don t understand why they are so hard to find 
5 5 i love these pacifiers they are perfect for my little one to hold on to 
5 5 my grandbabies love this it s a nice size shape to hold and they can get the pacifier into their mouths pretty easily 
5 5 wonderful the only pacifier my son will tak 
3 3 nice to carry along but the colors is not given since it is random color sent i have a boy but they send me purple case so didn t use it and gave to my cousin for her baby daughter she likes it and it keep the paci clean will be better if we order as for boy girl that can random select colors for girls pink purple yellow red and boys red green blue yellow instead upon buying options 
5 5 amazing so amazing my little guy sleeps with this every night and he has for the past 17 months we bought a spare just in case 
5 4 started using these when my newborn got fussy at nights helped her relax very good she likes the shape of these the best over a couple others that we ve tried to use i like that you can stick them in her mouth right side up or upside down and it doesn t matter also the glow in the dark feature is great in the rare occasion she is in her bassinet at night i can look over and see the pacifier moving in her mouth or laying next the her easily i ve bought them for other mothers 
5 5 it is good 
5 5 very good 
5 5 absolutely love it i m going to have to buy more 
5 5 happy i received the correct item
2 2 not practical
5 5 great as a gift or for your own little one 
5 5 great price and so fun my baby doesn t like many other pacifiers tommie tippee evidently knows how to mimic an actual nipple when compared to other brands 
5 5 my 3 month old loves these they are lightweight and easy to clean the handle is very useful too 
4 4 my baby won t take any brand of pacifier that being said he loves to get put the toy in his mouth my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the kitten is tiny think beanie baby in a happy meal size in their defense it did say kitten not cat touch if buy another one i m buying a giraffe 
3 5 ok
5 5 perfect price for these great soothers 
1 1 the paci is so big my kids hate it seems to take forever to take a temp by the time it s done they are crying and it s been out of their mouth several times because of the size i love the idea but this one isn t for us i don t think it s returnable or i would 
5 5 my grandbaby loves this sooo much 
5 5 baby s fave 
5 5 absolutely adorable 
5 5 baby likes them 
5 5 baby loves his wubbanubs zebra is super cute and attractive to baby due to the black and white high contrast the easiest of our wubbanubs to find in the dark 
5 5 i love these pacifiers too bad my baby doesn t like any pacifiers at the moment 
5 5 this is a backup to the one we already have they wash up great and needed one for when the other is being laundered not a clean sock or mesh bag is great for protecting it from other items and hang dry in less than a day 
5 5 great pacifiers so great my dogs won t stop eating them i m convinced they smell like dog treats so that i have to continue buying pacifiers each month conspiracy 
5 5 my daughter loves this binky 
5 5 i bought this for a baby shower of a friend who just gave birth i was very busy at work and couldn t shop personally so was very happy to find this gift i was crossing my fingers that it would be all that the picture indicated i was extremely happy when i got it it came in a beautiful box all ready with a card on it it arrived on time i was very pleased and my friend loved it perfect for those who look for a practical yet beautiful gift 
5 5 i ordered this for my sister while she was pregnant and i m glad i did the blanket and burp cloth sure come in handy for swaddling burping we use everything in this set all the clothes are adorable fit well wash easy everything here makes a wonderful baby shower gift or even are great for new moms my only advice is to stock up on receiving blankets because they really do come in handy you can almost not have enough with a new born 
5 5 these are amazing
5 5 love these pacis all 3 of my kids have loved these and took them the easiest at birth and beyond the only disadvantage is that most pacifier clips don t work with these 
5 4 i was very pleased with my purchase and my little one loved it immediately the arrival took longer than it was expected but only by a few days happy purchasing
5 5 cute and fun faces baby loves it 
5 5 so cute soft beautiful love it 
5 5 my lo loves loves loves her goon goon kitty she has used it since day 1 and is 18 months old i wash it in the washer once a week or so and put it in the dryer in a pillow case the pacifier part is starting to sgow wear but we are about to weam her off and just give her the animal perfect timing we will most definately be buying this product for the next baby when she was tiny i loved it bc it would help her keep it in her mouth 
5 5 great
5 2 i don t like this paci because i think it was one of the factors into altering our son s palate shape he was given this in the hospital and loved it we were disheartened when the pediatrician recommended that we get rid of this as soon as she saw we were providing it to him she said that the shape was not wide enough to support the palate she was right we did switch him to a mam and he is now paci free but i wish he hadn t started on this one his mouth has a slight curvature now that may need braces for correction since neither his father nor i had braces as kids this is a huge bummer 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 my baby boy will only take these pacifiers 
5 5 after many attempts to find a pacifier that my son would take we settled on tommee tippee closer to nature there is no upside down as with other brands as the symmetrical shape allows for your little one to put the pacifier in all by themselves with no fuss now when someone gives him a different brand he immediately spits it out and reaches for this one the 0 6 months pacifiers were used constantly and we never had an issue with any of them wearing out or needing to be replaced the only downside is the cute designs on the face will scratch off between being placed in the dishwasher to clean and little fingers grasping for the pacifier 
5 5 my baby loves it 
5 5 the only pacifier my lo will take i don t smell the rubber like some have complained 
5 5 my son loves this 
2 2 we transitioned from the soothie and my son seems to like them he wouldn t take it at first but he s getting used to it i m disappointed because i bought it for the glow in the dark feature and it glows for about a minute 
5 5 the delivery was just in time and the product all i expect 
5 5 we were gifted these at our shower along with some other popular orthodontic based pacificers in more traditional shapes with our little one s tiny face and how giant this shape looked i didn t bother trying them until about 2 weeks in when i decided to sterilize them and add them to her rotation just because well surprise she only loves these now to the point they actually work and help her quiet down to sleep no idea about nipple confusion we exclusively pump and we ordered more 
5 4 as described
5 5 my baby girl loves this cute little binky lovie i think i m buy another from this seller as a back up 
5 5 love this product my daughter loves it and i love how they can cuddle with it 
5 5 everyone got a kick out this very funny mustache it has been the main thing for the baby when taking pics
3 1 the sound stopped working after two years worked well until then but for the money it should last longer 
5 5 bought this as a gift for a friend expecting twins they love it because they now they don t need dual monitors 
5 4 good
5 5 the 7 am le sac igloo is great very warm and easy access love it so much and my 5 months old loves it too as she is very comfortable in it we use l l beans before this and find the 7 am much warmer for my baby will recommend anyone to get one and try it out to know the experience 
5 5 my daughter loves this toy
3 3 cute but really small
5 5 works well
5 5 great seat for my grandson once he reached 6 months even take it to restaurants he loves it 
5 4 great bottles my breastfed daughter would not take a bottle after trying many different types finally saw mam nipples was intrigued so tried it and wala she loves it she does not like pacifiers so i docked a star because i would prefer a bundle without a pacifier included 
5 5 excellent for price
5 5 daughter in law and son really have used the belly buds clever 
5 5 very cute addition to our playroom
5 5 grandson loves tools like daddy
5 5 love this bag it s so convenient to wear when traveling with a little one it has tons of compartments and its very cute i m constantly getting asked where it s from i highly recommend it and wish i would have found it sooner 
5 4 works great
5 5 great quality perfect size for my grandchildren
5 1 front wheel shakes at a walking speed a plastic piece wore through on the canopy a month after my son was born so with little to no use cheaply made 
5 4 i love this couch it was the only cute toddler couch i could find that didn t have tacky cartoon characters on it the quality is great as well my only complaints are that the microfiber stains easily and is pretty pricey 
5 5 i got exactly what i expected
5 4 the entire bed came in one small box which was surprising all of the pieces were there and the directions were easy to follow the most difficult part was trying to keep the slats in place while i secured the other side of the bed other than that the bed is wonderful and my 2 year old daughter loves it 
5 5 love dr brown bottles
4 3 love the mobile but it did not fit on our crib which is a standard wooden panel crib the white plastic base is not wide enough we had to make adjustments to get it to fit on our crib
5 3 the design it great no deep seems to collect grim dumps pretty easy doesn t slide around too much we have a few issues with this potty 1 the hole in the seat is too wide for my daughter she can sit on it and doesn t fall in but just barely i think it is her hip bones that stop her from falling in this makes it uncomfortable for her to sit on long enough to do her business 2 the pee guard in the front is too high for her it makes it hard for her to sit down she doesn t clear the pee guard bumps her bottom on the guard our other potty is for girls and is flat all around she is used to being able to start to sit then position herself on the potty i was shopping for a potty to put in her room that she can use when she wakes up since my daughter is over 2 i thought she needed a bigger potty this was advertised as for bigger kids but my kid is not big enough for it she is 28 lbs 60 and is 50 for height so your average 3 foot tall 2 5 year old the height of this potty is perfect her knees are nut bent up to her chin the back is nice except that she can t put her back against the back rest without almost laying down 
5 5 very easy to use and very sturdy 
5 1 when i purchased this i thought i was purchasing a bracelet for an adult that could be used as a teething instrument for a baby while being worn by an adult this is an actual baby bracelet to be worn by a baby and used for teething i will say that it has a sturdy clasp but even so it is a choking hazard a baby should not wear a bracelet precisely because it could be a choking hazard even with a sturdy clasp all that chewing and sucking could undo the clasp it is plastic that screws together 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my daughter would use we love our wubbanub monkey 
5 5 can t find in stores only have the frog and dog in the brus stores went well with nursery theme
5 1 i bought this product thinking my 10 week old son would enjoy it i set him in the bouncy chair and let the bear sit on his lap with it turned on i was watching him and realized the fur was covering his hands it wouldn t come off so i had to actually run his hands under water and i had to scrape his tounge off since he had it all in his mouth from his hands i would think for the price that he material would be better and not just falling out and everywhere seriously though the fur is a huge choking hazard 
1 1 the pacifier nipple is extremely hard and too hard for a baby to use total crap
5 5 good
5 4 these are our favorite fit so far but they do fill up with water in the sterilizer and i don t like that
5 2 not what i expected kinda big for babies face 
4 1 our baby tolerates them but they are not the same shape at all as the closer to nature bottle nipples which is the whole reason i bought them she would rather suck on an empty bottle nipple also the plastic packaging is not a case as it would seem it has no means of resealing once the tape is cut the glow is the only redeeming factor as it is nice to see if she is still sucking on one in the dark 
5 5 great pacifiers quality plastic and the baby loves them bought two packs to make sure we don t lose any 
5 5 sam kind we received from hosp baby loves them
5 3 each baby is different so hard to find ones that a particular baby 34 likes 34 
5 5 my new born loved these 
5 5 great exactly what we needed
5 5 it s my baby s favorite pacifier now 
5 5 good
1 1 do not purchase this monitor i purchased this monitor based on my trust for the motorola brand and from reading reviews and i seriously regret it the first monitor stopped working after 5 6 months and motorola replaced it only for the second to stop working after 5 months both times i had the same issue of the parent monitor is not charging when i spoke to both the representative and the manager at motorola they both basically told me it was too bad that it broke because once you get a replacement you only have a 90 day warranty they only thing they could do is replace it for 80 and it will still only come with a 90 day warranty i argued to no avail at least asking for a longer warranty of 90 days if i was to pay motorola should be ashame to continue to sell a monitor that is made to last no longer than 6 months they should even be more embarrassed by their terrible customer service that believes it s okay to charger parents 200 after taxes for a piece of junk 
5 5 loved it
5 5 has everything a mother would need grooming wise even has toy 
1 1 it doesn t stick to my shower a waste of my money
5 5 never had one before but i think it s great quality for a great price 
1 2 doesn t stay on slanted back window 
4 2 i like it but it has i like it but it has a little scratch 
5 2 i ordered this when planning a picnic for my husband over valentine s day weekend i really like the chevron pattern and neutral colors and it is easy to pack up however while the material is waterproof it s not soft or comfortable and it reminds me of heavy duty tarp that crackles whenever i shift around on it plus the size is too small for two adults to lay out on i had also bought the 5x7 jj cole blanket at the same time and i like that much more because the material s a lot softer and the larger size is great so i ve decided to return the skip hop one 
5 5 definitely worth it it worked and made pumping time go by faster because i could use my hands i loved it 
5 5 great product and price 
5 5 these are so soft we are about to have our 5th baby and i ordered one of these to try i wish i d found them sooner i will be purchasing more 
5 5 a great owl to add to my toddler s growing collection this guy is quite large too we call him 34 big owl 34 not really good for cuddling up with but he s a keeper anyway 
5 5 great quality plenty of options for sound and volume projector is great and holds extra options for projection pictures 
5 5 we moved to this from our infant bucket seat and are very happy with it our 13 month old is still sitting in it rear facing she s 60 for height and she s very comfortable lots of padding she seems comfortable and it s a super easy install with the latch system 
5 5 really cute bed just perfect as my grandson s first toddler bed easy to put together 
5 5 got this battery after my graco monitor battery ran out after heavy use for two years installed this battery without and issues recharged without any problems works great have been using the monitor with the new batteries for about 2 weeks now without any problems 
5 3 works as intended 
5 5 my daughter loves this bed 
5 1 straw cleaner broke within one day of use other parts are ok but the straw cleaner is the one you want to use usually love oko products but this is badly made 
5 5 amazing quality lots of room very impressed can t wait to use it :)
5 5 like it
5 5 makes my life easier
5 5 got this for baby s day care crib it has held up well 
5 5 excelente 
4 4 sticks well and has good coloring but i dislike how you can see the below sticker when another on is placed over it for example you can see the tree branch slightly through the monkeys head but would still suggest other get this my son loves it
5 5 very good product our boy loved it 
5 4 nice
5 5 we love the wubbanub my only wish would be for the pacifier to be rated hire than 6 months still worth 5 stars easy to wash easy to find and well worth the money 
1 4 good product i bought the ones that stated 0 6 months warning it s just 0 3 months 
5 5 my 3 month old loves this she s teething and loves to work on it no nipple confusion just a quiet happy baby that let s mama do some chores 
5 5 my grandson loves it it is easy to find when you need it 
5 1 the description for this nuk says 0 to 6 mo but it is 0 to 3 on the pkg i received today i also ordered some 0 to 3 mos so now i will have four alike not a happy camper 
5 5 fast shipping and great product 
5 5 excellent
5 5 great paci it came free with the car seat and is my daughters favorite 
5 5 the keep it keen pacifier works almost every time keeping the pacifier free of germs when dropped 
5 5 6 months later and my daughter is still in love with this thing 
5 5 my daughter is in love with the wub a nub if your child uses soothie pacifiers these are a must i like them because they are hard to lose with the size 
5 5 my baby is most thug on tha block now onelove
5 5 love these 
5 5 my favorite 
5 5 baby is very happy using this 
5 5 our favorite paci s by far and we have tried tons and tons with all 3 kids 
5 5 i love how conveniently packed it was and that it came before my little girl s expected arrival thank you will definitely be ordering another one soon 
5 5 does the job and my daughter likes these pacifiers over other brands easy to clean too 
5 5 awesome product
5 5 the pillow seems just right for my girls my oldest is 3 and had another pillow that just went flat my youngest hasn t used a pillow yet but i think she will like it 
5 5 this was a gift and the couple who received it like it alot 
5 4 this is one of my favorite baby products that i own we bought this for my daughter before she was born and use it literally everyday we also run it all night long she s two years and 4 months and i think we ve changed the batteries maybe 4 times it has great features and is portable i bought another for my baby son and two more for gifts 
5 2 i have to use 2
5 5 great bottle for my baby breastfed at home and bottle fed at the babysitter very easy transition 
5 5 shipped in a timely manner product exactly as shown and packaged nicely will be very cute in pictures
5 5 excellent 
5 5 love these diaper covers i have four other thirsties duo wraps 3 of them are also hook loop we prefer the hook and loop it s easier to get a good fit on my chubby thighed baby the velcro is very strong on these i ve only been cloth diapering for about 5 months and i wash every 2 3 days and they have held up great so far it seems like the velcro will last for a long time i use these over prefolds during the day and over fitted diapers at night my son is a chunky 23 lb 6 month old and he s wearing size 2 on the smallest setting so these should fit for a long time 
4 2 architecturally speaking this chair is beautiful practically speaking it s kind of a nightmare particularly around the 5 point 34 harness 34 and its installation the only time it kind of worked was when the attachment to the tray was installed but it only works attached to the tray when the seat is on the highest rung and our baby was lowered at 6 months because he s so tall the straps fall out the back they do not stay in place and our baby was slipping down through the front and out the back while we were trying to just strap him in death hazard right there if we weren t standing right over him seriously a baby could hang himself or asphyxiate if unattended with this ridiculously cheap incredibly poorly designed basic safety feature if you have an older child it would be a great chair but badger basket has nothing on stokke or svan and it shows in the price do not cheap out and save 50 200 by buying this one if it is the aesthetic 34 look 34 you want otherwise chicco makes some nice easy to use can always find the straps adjustable high chairs with seats that tilt and washable covers but they re basic and a lot less sleek 
5 5 love the item hate the fact it was 3 days late
3 1 i wanted to love this product but to work well it would requires to have the same size as the juice box i uses and it doesn t my son would pull the juice box away and the box loses its purpose
4 4 easy set up and reasonably priced 
5 5 good items
5 5 great for little accidents
5 5 this is the cutest and much loved item my great grandson has he loves it and it soothes him which i believe is most important for a teething baby 
4 4 would be a 5 star if it was actually spill proof my daughter keeps knocking it over and it leaks all over 
5 5 looks good sturdy and spacious 
5 5 these are exactly what i wanted they fit my 8 month old and 2 year old very easy to clean and quick to dry love them 
5 5 i love it i have large breasts and this fit perfectly the first time 
5 5 love this tree it was exactly what i was looking for easy to apply just time consuming looks great 
4 5 i wish the directions were a little clearer but it wasn t hard to put together once i figured out the tiny diagram 
5 5 the product came to me well and on time without any problem i m already using and it works perfectly totally recommend 
5 5 great design soft cover mom dad and baby like it 
5 5 so far my fav wubbanub love it get compliments all the time and it s soooo cute 
5 5 it is perfect my baby loves it i do recommend 
5 3 i liked these but my baby decided on a different kind 
5 5 really help me find them at night
5 5 these paci s glow brightly in the dark i was very pleased with them well worth the money spent 
5 5 my newborn only seemed to like these pacifiers for some reason i would recommend buying a couple as they do get lost easily 
5 5 only brand i will buy we love these i used them with my daughter and now we get these for my son 
5 5 great in the car at night prefect for finding in their crib in the dark so cute mam are the best pacifiers these were perfect for my 3mos old grandson they are well made and easy to clean 
5 5 my son is obsessed with these plus they re super easy to spot if they fly across the room 
5 5 cute print and great for night time 
5 5 my daughter loves wubbanub period she holds them close for security and when she s awake she holds onto the pacifier and plays with it 
5 5 my daughter likes these alot and i love that i can see them in the dark when i m trying to put her back to sleep 
5 5 great love it thanks a lot
5 5 cute baby gift
5 5 it was funny for adiaper cake
5 5 these are the best baby gifts to buy 
4 5 have not tried it yet but it looks good 
5 5 my son loves his wubbanub i m going to order another one for back up
5 5 roll big green 
3 3 the camera and base work well however the ac adapter that charges the parent monitor is very flimsy we have had 2 break in the past year and the problem is that the adapters are not easily replaced if you search amazon none of the compatible adapters are really compatible i contacted motorola they not only wouldn t send a replacement though to be fair it was outside the warranty period but they don t even have an option to buy the adapter i now have a 150 system collecting dust and have to buy a new system just because of the adapter 
5 5 excellent cup for my 9 month old the spout is soft and flexible 
5 5 very cute idea the chalkboard goes with all outfits and is unisex 
5 4 niece loved this
5 5 i bought this one as a gift but had 2 different britax back seat mirrors of my own and they are all great convenient and a must have for rear facing kiddos 
5 5 so much easier to carry this around 
5 5 i use this to wash cloth diapers it works great and always gets out the stains 
5 4 good cups easy to assemble and clean a little liquid will come out when you turn the cup upside down but this is the best leak proof cups so far we have tried one drawback we won t be able to buy replacement straws 
5 5 thank you all arrived safely
4 4 good my son loves it i cant give 5 stars because of the shower stuff it just holds a little water you have to refill it a lot
5 5 my almost 3 year old is still using it he climbs on it so easily and is relatively easy to clean 
5 5 good
5 5 they work as designed and stop my son from ruining the back of the seat in front of him while sitting in his car seat 
5 5 love these my son sometimes pees all over and has projectile poo so these come in handy i bought two packs 
5 5 excelente 
5 5 nice well made 
5 5 great price arrived quick and as expected
5 5 i love it great quality and my baby always sleeps in it 
5 4 we use cloth diapering and this is great for the price we wanted something affordable and good quality this is small so we have to do laundry every two days which we do already the slot for diapers isn t as small as others are complaining about we have a daughter that is 20 pounds and her diapers fit through it with no problem even aios nice pail for the price only downside is the smaller size 
1 1 sticker was mailed white u cant even see it on the wall i guess they expect you to have black walls to see sticker i asked for a return the emaik back said 34 it said it was white 34 but the sticker picture is black how stupid is that to only sell white stickers but have a picture of a black one dnt buy i dnt recomend at all
5 5 love these bibs they re a must have once your little one starts feeding herself i would ve been changing her clothes a lot more often with a traditional bib this catches all the milk she dumbs food that falls out of her mouth etc 
5 5 my grandaughter loves this on her wall she recently got her own room and now it is all decorated in paris love love love this on the wall
5 5 love love love this diaper pail i have used other in the past and found this one to be better in a few ways first it does not smell i m not sure if that s because of the arm hammer baking soda that is released from the top of the pail when you add a new dirty diaper or the self sealing lid that twist the bag closed when the pail is not in use it s amazing no smell i also love the face that the bags are huge and can hold up to 2 weeks of diapers they are so easy to get in and out of the front of the pail and each individual bag snaps and seals at the top the bags are really strong so you don t have to worry about them tearing as you carry them out to the trashcan the only thing that would make this pail better would be a foot peddle so that i can quickly ditch the dirty diaper while carrying my baby out of the room 
5 5 great purchase
5 4 good product the only problem is my baby outgrew it in a flash it wasn t very easy to take him out also 
5 4 looks nice and i worry free 
5 5 using these along with belly bands really extended my regular wardrobe further into my pregnancy i recommend these to all expectant moms 
5 5 love the glasses i purchased them for my 22 month old grandchild and they are unbreakable the first challenge they went through was being twisted around and they made it good price also 
5 4 great soft and no slip i took one start out because the indent on the side for kids to hold is too shallow kids need something to grad to feel secure just my 2 cents 
5 4 super cute 
5 5 i brought these for my grandson i guess its a matter of preference he likes them over the other ones his mom brought they are small enough to fill his mouth without him straining to get a grasp on it 
5 4 very good
5 5 a life saver the only paci our baby would take and we tried mam avent munchkin you name it 
5 5 love the soft nipple and the fact it is one piece it s the only pacifier either of my breastfed kids would use 
5 4 wing aren t even stuffing comes through seams but my son loves it so i guess none of that matters
5 5 perfect recomended 
5 5 absolutely adorable a must have 
5 5 my son currently 3 5 months old only likes the avent soothie pacifiers so when i found these i was very excited they aren t the cheapest but it was worth the money before my son could grab i would put this on his chest and it would stay close to him even when he spit out the pacifier and he was less likely to spit it out because the kitten held it some now that he is learning to use his hands he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs usually a foot into his mouth to wash it i just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry it turns out great the kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older when it drops to the floor it doesn t bounce like the pacifier would without the kitten so i haven t lost it in the 2 months we ve been using it 
5 3 love these but wish you could choose a gender neutral color last time i ordered i got pink and purple this time it s a little better with red tulips good thing my husband doesn t mind
5 5 love these helps my baby keep it in her mouth she loves snuggling them especially the lamb 
5 5 these are amazing i have one in every space kitchen purse car stroller diaper bag to keep a clean pacifier they are so handy the hook is perfect 
5 2 if you re desperate for sleep and looking for a solution to your baby losing the pacifier at night save your money and rest assured that the time when baby can put the pacifier back in without help will come here s why you should skip the wubbanubs 1 they re too small and lightweight to really hold the pacifier in place 2 they may contribute to the problem my son yanks on the animal and then ends up with a leg or ear in his mouth crying in frustration the animal is just another means for pulling out the paci 3 the cleaning instructions for the pacifier and the plush part are different which makes no sense since the pacifier is sewn on it got a two star rating because they are cute and double as a toy 
5 5 in addition to pacifier wipes i used these for quick cleanup on breast pump parts basically the same thing as the cleaning wipes that are sold specifically for pumps but they are smaller so they last longer they are also much less expensive 
5 5 as described 
5 5 great binkies
5 5 always love these easy for baby to hold
5 1 the thermometer no mater what pack it comes in never works 
5 5 these are very well made priced well i got them as decorative for a baby shower to top a gift nice pastel colors to choose from
5 5 love these they dont lave marks on baby s face 
4 2 i wish i had seen a picture of the nipple shape before purchasing it is not shaped like other avent pacifiers that we use and therefore my baby isn t into it 
5 5 just what i wanted
5 5 he likes it 
5 5 my daughter loves these 
2 2 i did not read the description well enough but was very disappointed to find that the bink is stitched into the stuffed animal not easy to truly sanitize so i returned 
5 5 as expected
5 5 if you re reading this review you probably already know that wubbanubs are awesome pacifiers we use them in the nicu where i ve worked and they are perfect even from the very start this review is more about why the owl is the best of the wubbanubs we have this one and the giraffe and i ve encountered many others at work and that friends kids have this one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others the soothie pacifier is not super light and the giraffe s head and neck flops all over the place when i m holding it my baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out the owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall if the pacifier falls out my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash she also likes to grab his wings and feet some of the newer wubbanubs come in bright neon colors but i like that this one looks like a normal animal and of course owls are super in these days there are a lot of cute wubbanubs out there but in my opinion this one is the best the only negative i would say and this applies to all wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers is that you really shouldn t let your baby sleep with them we use ours primarily in the car but sometime around the house too we just use a regular avent pacifier for overnight though as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight especially when very young ;)
5 5 both of my children love mam pacis and bottles these are adorable and a good fit for a newborn s face 
3 5 ok
5 5  
5 5 best things ever made i don t ever lose the pacifiers and it keeps me from buy some every week easy to wash also 
5 5 although my daughter didn t take to these we have the cow too at first now that she can more easily grasp onto it herself she loves them 
5 4 good paci my son used it without any complaints 
5 5 love this product fast service
5 2 one came broken with hole at the tip and baby took in a lot of air and we ended up with a rough night no sleep baby was fussy all night 
5 4 look cool 
5 5 had the newborn one and now bought these since he s 4 months old baby loves loves it he calms down right away he doesn t get nipple confusion either i can take it away and breastfeed him right afterwards i so suggest to wait atleast month after baby is born if you want to avoid nipple confusion
5 5 my kid likes hugging the monkey 
5 5 great for finding in a dark room in the night 
5 5 my grand daughters love it 
5 5 i love this pacifier i bought it for my son and he sucks it i have gotten so many compliments on it 
5 5 have to buy another giraffe because my daughter can t sleep without it and we just lost it at the grocery store lesson learned and i m buying 2 so we have one for back up
5 5 this is basically the best idea since diapers and onesies my son loves his monkey so much he holds hands with him when he sleeps we bought several so we have them in all his nap places 
4 4 works good pain to put on 
5 5 super soft stays soft after washing and doesn t stain the blue color is true to the photo fits the summer infant changing pad perfectly however there aren t any holes to fit the pad s safety straps through but that was no problem for us as we don t use them we use the pad on the floor of our living room when changing diapers downstairs the price can t be beat 
4 2 needed a stroller for two and did not want to spend a lot of money the stroller has many good features and i like the fact that it is bright orange you can spot it in a sea of other stollers at the amusement park but is very bulking heavy and worst off very hard to maneuver i am a 215lb average strength althletic male and i need to use all of my strength and weight to push it around my wife is significantly smaller so imagine how difficult it is for her the biggest factor is that the front wheels has a bar that supposed to allow the wheels to either lock into one position or spin but in the unlocked spin position it is so tight that you either have to lift the front end to turn or use all of your strength weight i would not recommend this item 
3 5 ok
5 5 we strapped these to our car seat and love them the rattle noise is a soothing sound not hard and plastic sounding the colors captivate our little one 
5 5 this carrier has saved our twin life it is the best designed carrier i have ever had i have had an ergo becco mei tai they thought of everything the head cover cinch down just right both carriers are comfortable when worn separately the pockets are large and fit a wallet and phone and keys they all fold inside the pockets i have no complaints which is a lot coming from me my only complaint is that it doesn t come with a full time nanny i could use that 
5 5 color match perfectly with my son s bed
1 1 these won t stay together after having them for a month the velcro loses it stickiness after just a couple of weeks i literally thought that these were a hand me down because they were so useless my wife set me straight these were purchased on our baby registry very recently we threw them away and got other bibs that worked much better soon after 
5 5 love this product this product fits nicely and is soft and well made 
5 5 i really like the way this looks easy to put together perfect storage solution for the price doesn t look cheap and about to fall apart all the time 
5 5 i bought this after accidentally flashing a stranger at a children s museum in my old cover this is a great size and keeps me covered even with a wiggly 6 month old the pattern is cute too 
5 5 i had heard about this teething necklace from a blog i follow it caught my attention as i loved the color combos as well as how each 34 gem 34 was cut so it did not resemble a circle when i received the necklace it came in a sealed bag i honestly liked that as it made me feel better about handling of it prior to getting to me i opened the bag and did a quick wash with it as i do with any toy my son will end up chewing within means i let it dry the rest of the day on the next day of receiving the necklace i pit it on in the morning oh wow my son was so amused by it at first he kept pulling on it i will say the necklace came to about my breasts below then i think a light switch turned on as he began to out it in his mouth sure what baby does not put items in their mouth i believe although i can not have him verbally tell me but he enjoyed this teething necklace i too enjoyed the colors and i think once he would grows this phase may continue to wear it as it is a very nice statement piece i do like the pricing on the necklace i chose this one due to the colors but have to say it was one of the lower priced ones i have seen necklaces doubled if bot tripled what these necklaces are running overall great product and i have already told friends about them i am thinking about getting some as gifts for two friends who are expecting 
4 4 i don t really know what i expected but i expected it to bounce a little when i turned it on so far all i ve seen or rather felt it do is vibrate at least my son seems to like it 
5 5 for 8 this hammock is huge perfect for my daughters room 
5 5 all is good here no issues fast shipping packs really well what more can i ask more aaaaaaaaaa
5 5 expensive yes but lasts for days the hospital gave me a free sample and i loved it really helped with the pain and healing process 
5 5 these are incredibly soft much softer than any other brand i ve tried thick enough to prevent leaks and launder much better than i was expecting they still look new after months of washing would recommend a larger quantity if using daily i immediately wished i had bought more 
5 5 i love them 
5 5 i order my new grandchildren these banks i love them 62 
5 5 my baby loves this pacifier it s his favorite soothies are the only kind he will use it s a cute soft dino and works wonderful easy to locate thanks to the design my son is sooo attached to it we even named him 34 waldo 34 because whenever we need it we say 34 where s waldo 34 it s a life saver for sure 
5 5 bueno
5 4 has three great different settings for music numbers and animals which is neat one downside is that the keyboard itself is fabric and hard for my son to press the keys down 
5 5 i use these for dog beds they work great 
5 5 muy bien
5 3 soft but the milk soaks right through them 
5 5 this works really well i was surprised 
5 5 perfect size and style great value as well
5 5 i bought this for my grandchild it is much easier to tighten with the knobs that i found fussing with the strap in the front that is in my daughter s car 
5 5 i m not super thrilled about the sort of fancy edges of these however having a drawer full of solid white mittens where i can just grab any two has been fantastic i have to really pull on the elastic to keep them from digging into his skin but he maybe has chubbier than usual wrists and once i pull them till they pop once or twice they fit fine why on earth do babys socks and mittens only come in packs where you never have more than two that match each other ugh 
4 4 wish it was a little longer other than that it s a great cover
5 5 excellent thank you
1 5 the nipples don t collapse there aren t a million pieces and they don t leak everything i need note if the nipples do start to collapse it s because the little vent has gotten stuck or sealed simply pinch it from the inside and that fixes the problem also i once had the experience where the milk was coming out way too fast this was because the vent had been turned inside out during cleaning and hadn t popped completely back into place once i got the little vent to it s proper position the problem was resolved
5 5 this comes in handy quite often the colors are bright the material is durable and best of all it folds up into a small carrying case that you can throw just about anywhere we keep ours in the trunk of our car but it barely takes up space in the base of the stroller if we take it for picnics 
5 5 very nice my preschooler loves it 
5 5 this has been the perfect bassinet for our baby my wife and i looked at numerous stand alone bassinets and decided to go with the chicco playard because we could not justify buying an expensive bassinet that we would only use for a few months and we also did not want something cheap we were a little hesitant to buy this playard because we were unsure of how well it would work as a bassinet but it has been great our baby has no problem falling asleep and the little mattress is perfectly comfortable it is also washable setup was easy even though i read several reviews saying it was a pain in the butt for the most part it was self explanatory and it only takes a few minutes to break down for transporting the best part of this playard is it s functionality the changing pad hangs over one side so when the baby needs to be changed just flip it over and it s ready it says to buckle the changing pad down but i don t leave the baby alone so i don t bother when i m finished changing the baby just flip it back over the side and it s out of the way there are also several very convenient pockets to store diapers wipes cream etc right below the changing pad area other great features include the wheels on one side for easy transporting of the unit around the house as well as the night light vibrations and music we are also at ease leaving her in this bassinet because of the mesh all the way around her no fear of her sufficating when she is able to roll over i will continue using this for our future children and it will be a great playard when it s no longer needed as a bassinet i highly recommend this product over any stand alone bassinet let me also clarify that our baby is sleeping in our room and not her nursery so there is not a changing table in our room if you have a changing table in the room your baby will be sleeping in then this may not be as useful to you as it has been for me 
5 5 just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie 
5 5 excellent
5 4 great except comes in a bag rather than the original packaging 
4 5 finally of all the random products i have not cared too much about over the years bibs have been a cause of annoyance for me the cloth ones stain and some of the 34 waterproof 34 ones start to smell moldy after a little i tried the baby bjorn ones but those were so stiff they felt like body armor these are soft silicone so they sit comfortably on my toddler and they roll up easily to go in the diaper bag i simply rinse it after use or use a napkin to wipe it down the pocket is absolutely essential and catches food and milk with every meal my only complaint is that it doesn t quite get tight enough around the neck so sometimes food will still dirty her collar also the clasps sometimes come undone while she is eating 
3 3 i wish the sounds were louder :(
5 2 disappointed in this product the material is thin and offers hardly any cushion as claimed in the product name the neoprene and velcro are nice quality but the padding is non existent it is truly a shame because this is exactly what we were looking for in terms of size and it fit nicely on the britax car seat more padding needs to be added 
5 5 super cute 
5 5 thumbs up
5 5 i love ecoable diapers especially the charcoal bamboo ones less staining to worry about they also have a wonderful double leg gusset that eliminates leaking i also love the snap placement more options for the best fit also you have the pocket option for doubling inserts for longer wear but the sewn in pad is great and seems perfectly sufficient i am comparing the ecoable diapers to alva and kawai with both of those you ll notice leaking around the edges with ecoable you will have a harder time knowing when a change is needed which is a good thing right i d like to see more gender neutral patterns and call me crazy but i d like solids in basic white or black 
4 4 i like simple and this is simple it s a great mirror only problem is it does tend to slip a bit i need to adjust it often 
5 5 out baby loves this gave it to her around 2 months of age and she loved kicking it and playing music 
5 5 great gate 
3 3 it is not exactly what i was hoping for bigger then expected 
5 5 works perfect on wide stairs to keep dogs out 
5 5 these are virtually indestructible exactly what we needed 
5 5 this kitty is so cute my son was rejecting all pacifier then started taking this one when i offered it to him he likes to hold on to it i love that it helps keep the paci in his mouth and it s cute 
5 5 too cute and at a great price thank you
3 1 it is very cute but the toy doesn t hold it in her mouth not worth the money
5 5 all is good here no issues fast shipping packs really well what more can i ask more aaaaaaaaaa
5 5 great bag looks like it will hold everything
5 5 i wish i would have known about these sooner they are a definite must have for car seats along with everything else they are so easy to find in the dark in the crib i will be buying these for new moms from now on 
5 2 i love these pacifiers i had a hard time finding any past 3 months though came across these and though i hit the lottery when they got to my house they were def 0 3 mo i was upset to say the least 
5 5 these glow for a long time make making it easy to find at night 
5 5 seriously i probably spent a fortune on these because my baby hated having a tether on them and these suckers can roll it s quite amazing how far they can end up and in completely different directions then they initially bounced off in 
5 5 baby boy loved them 
5 5 love the glow feature my son likes to throw his paci around and this makes it super easy to find in the middle of the night he has even been able to find it on his own if it stays in the crib 
5 5 just what we needed to avoid the pacifier from always falling out nice soft animal makes for a cute lovie 
5 5 my son loves it it s really hard to find pacifiers for 2 years old
5 3 it works sometimes as long as baby is laying completely flat it is alot smaller than i thought worth the price no 
5 5 holds up to the dishwasher well our little one loves them 
2 4 cute game to play but wish the pacifier were on better paper so it doesnt rip when try to take tape off on the back
5 5 yup it s a mustache and a pacifier works as advertised 
5 5 our newborn loved this product it was the only pacifier she would use 
1 2 baby doesn t like it and never use it
5 5 my 2 year old is just addicted to pack s she used to only take the avent ones but was willing to use these as well cute designs and soothes a fussy girl prices are good so i buy extra because you never want to be without a paci 
5 5 perfect
5 5 baby loves it
4 4 my sons favorite pacifier but not my first choice both of my kids have decided that these pacifiers were their favorite however the issue that i have with them is that it isn t all one piece what ends up happening is dirt soap water etc is able to get into the pacifier i m usually able to clean them out for a while but eventually they end up needing replaced i wish that my kiddos would have picked a pacifier that was all one piece of plastic so that i could clean them easier oh well 
5 5 all is good here no issues fast shipping packs really well what more can i ask more aaaaaaaaaa
5 5 good
4 4 the item is not from hawaii medical but from jollypop and it s not what is pictured luckily it s the same exact thing except the color is off clear with pink around the rim it is bpa phtalate and latex free and it s made in the us the material is medical grade silicone it s very soft and just like the one she got from the hospital it almost feel like it s slightly better it actually turned out to be my then 4 week old s favorite she s now 10 weeks and has been using it everyday literally i m going to order more and i would definitely recommend to others i only gave 4 stars because it s not what s pictured 
5 5 my son loves this had it for 8 months still in one place :)
1 3 pacifier is not removable 
5 4 perfect
5 5 very cute haven t used it yet but my son has a few others and he loves them great for a 3 month old to hold on to 
5 5 love mam pacifiers they are the only ones any of my kids will use 
5 5 my baby loves this particular brand i m not sure why maybe because they fit better orally in his mouth then other cheap brands like that they are backed by the orthodontal docs 
5 5 i love this pacifire we used the plain ones and they were always falling out and into the ground with the kitty attached it sits nicely on her chest she hugs it very light weight adorable great quality highly recommended
5 5 adorable pacifier my daughter loves these about 5 inches long perfect for little hands wish pacifier was interchangeable
5 5 i love these they were excellent when my baby was 1 6 months 
4 4 shipping was very fast the kitty is very soft and not too heavy this was suggested to me by my doctor because my little baby girl kept spotting her nuk out it is a great concept but she does not like this particular type of pacifier i thought she would grow into it but she is 3 months now and still doesn t like it i wish you could change out the pacifiers the pacifier is stitched into the animal if your baby likes this type of pacifier it is a must have 
5 5 every baby loves these
5 5 good
5 3 john deer emblem wore off after a few times of washing
5 5 my daughter absolutely loves it it s do useful for car trips 
5 5 good seller fast will buy again thanks
5 5 nice
5 5 my son loves this binky its so soft and since he s a little older it fits perfectly in his mouth 6 months one 
5 5 got these for a co worker and fellow packer fan she loved them 
5 4 we have used a lot of these for our son now 18 months and they are great the only pacifier he will use 
5 5 my son loves this giraffe pacifier it is one of his favorites and we have been through a lot of them 
4 4 good quality it lasted my child 4 months with no problem i took one star off because you can t choose which color you want 
1 3 the black spots come off 
5 4 they are just a little hard to find at night but other than that great product 
5 5 my kid loved to traditional avent pacifier i decided to try these and they worked really well also cute and easy to hang onto with the more traditional handle 
5 2 i love the idea of a pacifier that pops closed when it hits the floor and it does seem to do this very well my only issue with this pacifier is that the plastic on the back of the pacifier is so cheap that it cracked very quickly making it so that we had to take off the wings that flip over the pacifier and basically had to use it as a really strange normal pinky 
5 5 these pacifiers are awesome they do indeed glow in the dark and boy do they glow my daughter is 6 months and constantly loses her pacifier in the night resulting in me having to zombie out of bed to find it for her but now she finds it herself 
5 4 i like these because they fall out they calm baby but then fall out during a nap so he doesn t get dependent on them i think they have been less habit forming than the brands that you need a crowbar to pry off that said it is annoying to constantly have to find them on the floor when baby spits them out and you sometimes have to hold them in baby s mouth when he is vertical 
5 5 my friend told me she loved this calendar so i bought it for another friend i hope she ll enjoy it just as much i think it s a great easy supplement or alternative to a baby book seems very simple user friendly and cute :)
5 5 only thing that has worked for my 9 month old overnight diapers leaked sizing up leaked double diapers leaked pull ups over regular diaper leaked we put this inside a regular diaper and it works we do fold it in half and put it in the front since she is a tummy sleeper 
5 5 works great when i first received the bibs i thought that it was weird that the bib is a little curved but it worked out well since the baby s chest is not flat my 22 month old did not object to the new bib as she s only used fabric bib up till now it s great for pasta with tomato sauce nights and soups as she likes to pick up the whole bowl and drink her soup that way the bib keeps her clothing much cleaner than fabric ones it s also easy cleaned and air dries easily or towel dry if you prefer good for travel as you really just need one or two per kid 
5 5 i bought this and several others of this brand to make a cloth diaper cake for my sister in law they were a great quality and worked out really nicely 
5 5 i love angel dear blankies and napping blankets i bought the giraffe napping blanket for my best friend s daughter 7 years ago and it s been passed down to her little sister and still looks and feels amazing even after 7 years of washing the tiger stripe blankie is just as cute and was a no brainer to buy as part of a baby shower gift set 
5 5 very satisfied a shopping experience product quality is very good very satisfied with the speed of logistics
5 5 perfect present for the newest member of a lovely family 
5 5 this item was purchased as a gift we were told by the parents that the baby likes it and is convenient for both the parents and the baby it arrived quickly and was as described 
2 1 this item is not really like it is shown it s really wobbly and doesn t hold anything i thought it would have been more sturdy but it s not i didn t like it
5 5 bought as a baby shower gift expecting parents loved the gift an idea 
5 3 the camera on this is top notch along with the controls but it lacks a noise filter level we operate a white noise machine in our daughters room and our old monitor used to only kick in when she cried or cough however this has a hot mic and we hear the white noise as if we are in the room with her all night long while i don t mind hearing the ocean i can certainly live without it if i had to do it all over again i would have bought something else that filters out the noise 
5 5 love this it s easy to install and makes your tv safe from accidental tipping i d rather be safe then sorry 
5 5 love this bag i also love that the changing table is attached to it super stylish and fits everything i need 
5 3 never used couldn t keep it to hold up with baby good quality and soft my baby didn t care for it
5 5 this works i can t tell you how many things i tried to soothe my screaming baby all the 34 old wives 34 remedies and a few things i found at the drugstore nothing worked finally i found this tea i liked that it was natural so i ordered it i can tell you that my little one is now calmer sleeping better and i am thrilled 
1 1 broke in 2 weeks 
5 5 great bath toy 
5 4 i like this jumper and the fact it can fold for storage or transportation it was easy to assemble and feels sturdy the weight limit on this is 25 pounds and is meant for babies who really can t walk on their own yet my son enjoyed it but now he can walk he won t stay put in it the seat does not rotate so the baby can only stay put and play with the toys in front they can chew and swat at the objects in front of them it s great if you are tight on space or want to transport around it is meant for younger babies who aren t very mobile or when you need them to stay put and do something i would recommend it to all new parents 
5 5 great product must have item for nursing mommies :)
2 3 my newborn son didnt want it 
5 5 fits all my son s stuffed animals very well made material 
5 5 easy to use and baby does not mind it 
1 1 picture shows 3 toys disappointed at the 1 toy that showed up this is false advertising
5 5 perfect
4 4 our little boy loves staring at the hedgehog and is slowly rocked to sleep quietly rocks baby which is something we were looking for the sounds are good but wish there was more volume control the only thing that keeps this from a five star is that the music isn t great but we don t really use that feature anyway 
5 5 this bathtub absolutely saved our sanity as first time parents our daughter hated bath time and we were always afraid that we were getting the water too hot turns out we were getting it too cold she loves bath time now and we couldn t be happier it was an instant success i will be purchasing these again in the future for baby shower gifts 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers that will stay in my 2 months old mouth for more than 30 seconds we have the giraffe and the lamb i wash them on gentle in the washing machine with no problem this has literally helped save my sanity our wubbanub arrived on time in the expected condition 
5 5 very pleased with the quality 
5 5 very comfortable good quality easy to install didn t take more than 20 mins 
1 1 no good was incomplete and the price is not good a lot of money for this i m very disappointed
5 5 i tried using both a bouncer and a swing for my colicky 2month old but neither seemed to work although the mamaroo is a little pricier than swings bouncers it sure is worth it my daughter loves being on it highly recommended 
5 5 love this bag perfect for lugging around the basics for my two toddlers my husband appreciates that it s gender neutral :)
5 5 worked out great ;)
5 5 my grand daughter loves it and uses it several times a day
5 5 way easier for my 1 year old to hold and get to her mouth than the super long and kinda skinny nuby ones i also have these are definitely well designed for a learner 
5 5 works great after use i just rinse off in warm soapy water let dry and use later it s great because i don t need to put them in the washing machine
5 5 perfect for my sons bed he loves them
5 1 ordered this and the package was opened with no nose frida inside like stated and only the 40 foam pieces what am i suppose to do with that without the actual product 
5 5 i love this chair i take it with me every time i head out of town or to a restaurant i love its small size portability and practical design it s easy to use clean 
5 5 so cute and sturdy 
5 4 this product is pretty cool but it takes a while and some extra effort to dry it after use 
4 5 received as promised 
1 1 unfortunately the reviews i read were correct this does not at all suction to the bottom of our tub it is not a completely smooth surface and this mat does nothing but float in the water guess we will have to try and find another use for it 
5 3 purchased to use for drying plastic tupperware lids and water bottles coming out of the dishwasher not for baby bottle use it works but the slots are a tad to narrow to fit those items design is great and looks nice on my kitchen counter
5 5 great toy easy to grasp and bring to baby s mouth i also bought the 4 inch ball and baby loves both 
5 5 affordable and effective
5 5 love that this company makes an effort for non toxic toys very well made teether also really love that these can be put in the freezer as there are not a lot of non toxic options that are freezable hope to see more products from this company
4 4 my baby seems to like it i do wish it had a way to have just the vibration or just the music and maybe a way to put music on it of my choosing 
3 3 was hopeing this would be the ticket to success but it was very short lived two days after getting it he could care less we have the potty time watch also very short lived i m desperate to get my son trained so i thought i d try this i believe this system is over priced and not worth it a short double sided book about using the toilet it was fairly frustrating to him that the book was upside down half way through and was for a girl i didn t expect for the price that i would have to put the velcro pieces on myself a very disappointing and tedious task that should ve been done by the maker the certificate is boring and did not impress my son whatsoever and 1 sticker that also held no interest i have found a small hope in the chart for training my son really really wants a fishing pole so when he fills the chart i will get him one and he also really wants a more expensive item which i ve promised only when he doesn t need diapers or pull ups anymore night time training isn t even a thought yet because daytime hasn t gone to we ll but i expect that will be even harder 
1 2 this gate is very flimsy in addition the metal parts are bright white and the vinyl material is beige it doesn t look anything like the online picture the actual item is kind of ugly and i definitely wouldn t want it in my home i returned it update the supplier did offer to either send me another product or refund my money i took the refund and did not require me to return the product it did have some scratches etc on it great customer service i gave them an extra star for that 
5 5 my baby girl loves them
5 5 very good anatomic and with excellent design 
5 5 the only binkys my daughter will take 
5 5 excellent product on time
5 5 i purchased this for a baby shower gift it is absolutely adorable comes with protective cover to protect the nipple was delighted with quality and fast shipment 
4 5 love these my son chewed through his glow in the dark pacifiers and so i had to throw them away i did not realize how great the glow in the dark feature is until we had to use a 34 daytime 34 binky at night i just wish avent wouldn t make some of their pacifiers with a 34 right way 34 to go in but i m not counting off a star over it because even when upside down my son doesn t seem to notice or mind 
5 4 i love these pacifiers unfortunately my son doesn t i love that these are all one piece of plastic if you ve tried different types of pacifiers then you know that some pacifiers get water soap and dirt down in them that make them impossible to keep around for very long since this pacifier is one piece of plastic all of these issues are resolved i ordered several different types of pacifiers to see which once my son would take to while i would have picked this one he didn t 
3 4 huge hit cons i had to have some one cut out the pacifiers and roll up tape before we could play but i really shouldn t expect more than a print out piece of paper for the price there is no mouth the picture shows a circle where the mouth should be but the poster didn t have that many quests were aiming for the nose because there was no mouth image 
5 5 great
3 3 really cute product but baby did not like them 
5 5 very good item
5 5 my baby loved these mam pacifiers the glow in the dark function is nice for sleep deprived parents in the middle of the night we used these during the day too i like the subdued colors makes it far less garish than some of those huge colorful pacis out there we did have to start using the larger 6 month version because these are quite small not a one size fits all deal 
5 5 my daughter loves these 
5 5 there isn t much more to say about wubbanub pacifiers other than that they are simply amazing they help keep up with the paci when it goes flying across the room it s easy to clean and wash it and my kid absolutely loves it we have three different animal versions of this paci 
2 2 baby didnt like them
5 5 so cute
5 5 best place to get is here on amazon i ve looked these have a smaller outer plastic than traditional avent paci and allow more air i tried several different brands but avent are the only ones she likes thank you for the calm nights haha 
5 5 love it 
5 5 awesome kids love these just wish i could remove the plush pet from the pacifier to wash it otherwise it s great 
5 5 its great to be able to get an all natural product with no compromise these are great and our baby loves them 
5 5 good product i like it
5 5 good quality paci wish my daughter would like it
5 3 my baby girl loves her elefant the only problem is that the pink is too light so it gets dirty fast and shows it we have a darker wubbanub and i like it more 
4 4 was not great quality i expected the stuffed animal to be bigger and heavier for the price my daughter doesn t care for it 
5 4 my daghter and i both love the wubbanub its great because its easy to find and the little stuffed animal keeps the pacifier in her mouth after her first wubbanub she disliked all other pacifiers it would be better if they made the stuffed animal where you change the pacifier also one that i purchased had ripped very easily at the leg but it was a simple fix with needle and thread and its still going strong today 
5 5 these little friends will save your life at 2 in the morning when your daughter son cannot find their pacifier wash well very durable 
5 1 never accurate 
5 4 this product is great almost perfect my little guy has had his monkey wubbanub since the day he was born he s now 2 i have three older children that i wish these would have been around for we spent a lot of money replacing missing pacifiers for them with that being said i do wish there was a way to easily replace the soothie i have had to hand stitch new ones on more than a few times now which brings me to the next problem he has become attached to his monkey he won t take the giraffe or frog that he has and we even bought a second monkey that he won t take he loves his two year old worn in monkey so when i decide to take away his paci i ll also be taking away his lovey at the same time it s not something i m looking forward to 
5 5 i just couldn t see a teddy bear making my little one fall asleep but it works i suggest you swaddle your child first then place the teddy bear down 
5 5 so cute i bought this for a friend s baby boy he really loves holding the giraffe while using the pacifier and his mom says she can cut the pacifier off when he gets older and keep the stuffed giraffe 
5 5 they are so cute 
1 2 these will not stay stuck to our marble walk in shower put them on s directed and within 20 minutes they fall off tried 4 different times to get to stick 
5 5 my daughter loves this cup i will be ordering a few more happy to get rid of the plastic cups 
5 5 gave this to my daughter and she said it works so good 
5 5 love it works great 
5 5 very soft quality
5 4 the nipples on these bottle collapse very easily and the caps don t stay on but i love the actually bottles i use them to mix formula and they are tall and skinny so my 3 month old can actually hold them when she tries 
5 5 beautiful frame thank you 
5 4 the baby likes it so i like it
4 4 our 6 month old son liked it but didn t really play with it that much very high quality though and we designed 
5 4 it was very hard to drink from at first even for an adult i had to chew on the hard valve in the straw to loosen it up but once i did that my 8 month old was able to drink from it like a champ the flow is faster than she s used to from the bottle or sippy cup spout but she s getting the hang of it this was a great alternative to a traditional sippy cup for us because she wants to drink from the cup but hasn t figured out how to tilt her head back far enough so we were always being called to come hold and tip it back for her now she can drink her water or juice when she wants to on her own 
5 5 this product is a life saver my son was 4 weeks old only sleeping 1 2hrs at a time before i found this product within a week of getting the wedge system pairing it with a swaddler he slept through the night it makes him feel more secure it gives me piece of mind knowing that he can t turn over in his sleep he is now 6 mos old still using it every night such a simple product that made such a huge impact in my life i would recommend it to anyone struggling to get their baby to sleep through the night 
5 1 these are a joke the crayon that goes inside the plastic sleeve falls out very easy when you are done in the bath or shower the crayon is wet from use so it will continue to leak a colored water all over the tube until it is dry cleans up fairly easy just annoying this bath toy would do best for children at least 4 yrs and older my two year old likes to make the crayon come out and either try to eat it or break it apart would not recommend 
5 4 easy to assemble and disassemble functional and not over the top 
5 5 a little gross to think about but it works so well on my two week old as well as on my 20 month old plus after reading about the inevitable mold that grows in classic bulb syringe i had to give this a shot 
5 5 my baby daughter will only use this kind of pacifier she is breastfeed and she would not take the other kinds especially the orthodontic kind with the funny end 
5 5 good size for 10 months 1 year my grandson enjoys pushing chasing the car 
1 1 i used it one time and after that it did not heat at all very disappointed 
5 5 love this just what my grand daughter needed when hers was destroyed it arrived very quickly and saved the day 
5 5 love these rather than buying separate stuffed animals and pacifiers nooks this gives the baby something to hold onto helps them find it when upset and are generally just awesome this particular one was for a gift and they love it 
5 5 these are my daughter s favorite pacifiers and they re so much easier to find at night with the glow in the dark 
2 2 bought this before i had my baby and i m not a huge fan of it now it s super cute but not practical at all 
5 5 good quality
5 5 we love wubbanubs 
5 5 i grandson just loves it 
5 4 my baby won t take any other pacifier the round bulb end make its easy to suck the only problem i have with these is that sometimes when i hand wash them water gets trapped inside the round dome on the front of the pacifier and then slowly leaks out which confuses and disturbs my baby i now just make sure to wash them with the nipple facing down so that water cannot get inside this compartment otherwise we are very happy with these pacifiers i do have to say that the 34 glow in the dark 34 features of these is extremely faint i certainly would not buy these just for that feature because at night you definitely can not see them in the crib 
5 5 works great
3 2 i bought it as a baby shower present and the product looked okay but the packaging was disappointing the plastic bag it was in looked to be about 5 years old it made it look like i had bought it years ago and stuck it somewhere until i found a use for it personally because of the packaging i am not sure that i would want a baby to use the pacifier 
5 5 our son has had his pandu for 5 years without the pacifier of course and it s become his lovey and part of the family 
5 5 love these 
5 5 these are my grandson s favorites 
5 5 perfect
5 5 these were the only pacifires my daughter would take so i m so glad i was able to find them outside of the hospital 
5 5 great pacifier this brand is the only one our granddaughter will take 
5 5 love the holiday moose the plaid accents are really cute and this one feels slightly higher quality construction compared to the already high quality of other wubbanubs purchased as a replacement to our first wubbanub which lasted nearly 8 months of hard usage if you don t have a wubbanub i strongly recommend them for babies 
5 5 terrific product we were given one of these as a gift and we loved it so much that we bought another so as to never be without one in fact i m buying some as gifts to other expecting parents 
5 5 came early baby not here yet but my son only liked the hospital kind so i got these for my baby girl 
5 5 good
5 5 perfect 
4 4 my son used it in the hospital and didn t have a problem with it compared to other pacifiers these are a bit heavier which lead to it falling out of his mouth more often they do get dirty easily with lint so watch out for that 
5 4 my 2 month baby love it 
5 5 we purchased the elephant at the same time as the giraffe and our baby loves his wubbanub because the stuffed animal keeps the pacifier centered and stable if he loses it from his mouth it stays reachable for him to find easily for a fussy baby this is a game changer 
5 3 works good if you can get the baby to use it ours was use to one that was different and she kept spitting it out 
5 5 loved the item purchased it for my sister and her unborn son she loved it 
5 5 bought a couple to give away as gifts super cute 
1 1 warning this is a novelty item only i bought this one because it s advertised as avent and it is however it is a piece of black plastic cut out in the shape of a mustache hot glued on to an avent pacifier this cannot be boiled to be sanitized or it will fall apart which is not in the listing at all suddenly i wish i had purchased one of the cheaper and sanitizer friendly alternatives that i saw 
5 5 my baby loved these we only used the until about 2 5 months these were the only type she took 
5 5 used this with my reborn baby and it gives the look of the old fashioned paci s 
5 5 best pacifiers doesn t make my baby suck in air
5 5 soo cute as others have posted i m sure it will be a pain to keep clean but i knew that when we bought it had to get it for the dragon haven t used it yet because we re still waiting on our son to come home from nicu but i m sure he ll love it cause it the same pacifier that the hospital uses 
5 5 we love this wubbanub and wish they sold this animal in stores 
5 5 they re binkies for a better price than in stores if you don t have prime they re a great item to bump you up to free shipping if you need them and who doesn t always need spare pacifiers if you have an infant 
5 5 everything ok 
5 5 so so cute i got this for a friend s baby shower it s adorable thank you so much 
5 5 these are my and my baby s favorite pacifiers i love them because they are natural rubber made of one piece so no hidden moisture mold bacteria issues and have the lowered curve to go below the nose the handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side it doesn t poke her in the face like others i ve used we also have the ummy and while it s similar i don t like how big the base is it covers too much of my baby s face for my comfort despite the holes in it it s also harder to figure out which way is up when it s dark and i m trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she s not using it for its intended purpose it s kind of funny to watch i was at whole foods the other day and saw the eco piggy which i almost bought to try but didn t based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge so i took it out to look at it and sure enough it s massive unless you have a mammoth sized baby i d skip that one we re both happy with the natursutten so i m sticking to this one for those who have complained about the rubber smell taste just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away 
5 2 my son didn t really take to these i wanted a soft pacifier to give him while he fell asleep and he never liked the soothie pacifier shape i didn t like the feel of these they had a 34 sticky 34 feel any tiny bit of fuzz stuck to these i thought they d be a smoother silicone like a soothie 
5 5 even cuter than the photo 
5 5 part of a baby gift that was in response to invitations that was monkey themed a hit at the shower score 
5 5 very cute 
5 5 nice look
5 5 my 1 year old grandson loved his first wubbanub and is now on his second and loves it even more this is so worth getting in that it never gets lost and tiny hands can grab it and place it in their mouths so easily 
5 3 good design nipple but surround part is more wider blocks the infant 20 days old nose little 
5 5 bought as a gift 
5 5 it s adorable well made my toddler granddaughter loved it 
5 5 now this is the bomb get alot of looks and works great
5 5 thank you 
5 5 thank you 
5 5 item was clean it arrived fast and on time my baby loves it thank you :)
4 4 it seemed like a great idea and i really like it but my little one does not care for it very much 
5 1 it leaves marks on baby s cheek
5 5 this is the second one i have bought because my lo lost her first 34 raffie 34 at the mall r i p raffie she is very atttached to him and so we got a new one i absolutely love these things they helped improve her motor skills and helped her self soothe which in turn she slept through the night which was big because she was a preemie i suggest them to every parent out there as they will be something for your child to have and save you from putting one back in every few minutes i read a few reviews about how they are poorly made and i think these people are just nuts it s perfect for a small baby soft and they can tug chew or throw them as they are just plush 
5 5 my babies favorite pacificer 
5 5 had to buy this after the dog ate her first one rush order can t live without it 
5 5 items were clean and as described my baby loves it thank you:)
1 1 i bought several packages of these some of them have holes in the nipples and some don t the ones that do have holes my daughter sucks in air so i had to throw them away i wouldn t buy them again 
5 5 we are huge john deere fans but just beware they do not have bulbs on the end to help the baby keep it in their mouth and they many not take any other binky but on that note they are perfect for nursing babies as they are more natural in shape 
5 5 nice
5 5 these are the only pacifiers i buy for my babies they are all natural and are easy to clean with no cracks or seams it is all one continuous piece so there are no place for germs to hideout 
5 5 perfect box for a pacifier i love it 
3 5 ok
5 5 shipping was fast and bag was exactly as it was decribed and pictured gave it as gift and she loved it 
5 4 christmas gift
5 5 really cute
5 5 such a fun toy reminds me of my childhood 
5 5 delivery delivered on time and satisfaction with products purchased
4 2 this is not a bad box but it is really way too big i realize i should have checked the dimensions listed but it is about twice as big as any sandwich you would ever make for a kid therefore it doesn t fit in a lunchbox and any standard kid s sandwich is going to slide around and get messy so my negative review isn t so much for the quality of the product but for the fact that they are marketing this as a 34 sandwich 34 container for kids when it is not an appropriate size for a kids sandwich 
5 5 love this little machine i only wish i had found it sooner worth every penny 
5 5 very sturdy easy to install and remove bought a total of three 
5 5 my daughter loves these she learned early on to find it on her own while sleeping at one i took the pacifier away by cutting it off and it was a smooth transition because she was so used to the comfort of the kitten she forgot about the pacifier 
5 5 my son did not like this that is not to say it s a bad product soothie type pacifiers just don t work for him this is well made and clean and he did enjoy holding the giraffe portion even if he didn t make use of the pacifier perfect size for an infant to practice holding items 
5 5 very cute and very funny to look at gave it to my nephew and i take photos of him every time my sister would suck this into his mouth 
5 5 keeps the little guy out of the kitchen 
5 5 never had to fight to get either of my babies to take medicine again it s an amazing product 
5 5 this is an excellent kit to use with the pump the cooler bag fits perfectly in the pump bag and the bottles are just the right size great purchase 
5 5 delivery delivered on time and satisfaction with products purchased
5 4 the listing for this product doesn t make mention of this so i just wanted to point out that the breast shields that come with this kit are actually fused with the valves the lids that screw onto the bottles in other words you can t rotate them out with a different shield regardless of this design difference this set of replacement parts for hygeia machines are much more reasonably priced than the replacement set that comes directly from hygeia and i m happy to report that maymom has excellent customer service 
5 5 super soft arrived quickly and exactly what i wanted 
5 5 awesome product 
4 5 very nice step stool small and short not as tall as a regular step stool made of bamboo arrived fully assembled i bought a bed that is taller than i m used to so i got this for a foot stool next to the bed perfect for my use one other thing is that it is fairly narrow as far as width goes my relatively small size six and a half feet do not fit fully on the stool s width but i don t need them too if you need a stool that your foot fits on completely this might not be the one for you 
4 3 easy to install try and screw into a stud though after a few month it gets worn in the sheet rock and it came right out with a small tug 
5 4 the suction cups hold the bowls down very well but i can say my granddaughter has pulled it up a time or two they wash well in the dishwasher on the top rack the lid is a nice feature on one of them 
5 5 kids love to flush this potty
5 5 has been great for nap time at school very durable 
5 5 this works perfect for me to put my purse on the stroller
5 5 love it now my whole house doesn t vibrate when my four year old shuts the door :)
5 4 it doesn t fit perfectly but at least works well in protecting our baby s eyes from his baby bath it s fairly cheap so i still find it as a good product 
5 5 i love love love this was a great buy for my now 7 month old who is a bit on the chunky side it is very spacious giving her plenty of room to roll around and play with her toys easy to put together and break down which is a great plus and the travel bag is awesome my only thumbs down is just i wish the padding was a little bit thicker my daughter likes to kick and sometimes i think she may hurt her little feet on the firm bottom 
5 5 arrived as described have had it for about a week and it s been great i sprayed a little window cleaner on the suction cups before sticking them to the tub and so far no issues with it falling down 
5 5 it removes the hassle and hurt of pumping worth every penny 
5 5 i love my daughter bag it was worth the money and perfect timing great product 
5 5 great diaper bag for 34 dad 34 to carry
4 1 well this product is good as described but the only problem that i found was the paint from the bird is coming off and that s is my only problem with this bouncer because babies will chew in all the plastic toys but this one is the only one that i notice the paint is coming off just be aware of this paint problem 
5 5 these work well and stay in place they are visually very nice as well and look classy unlike the plastic ones 
1 5 i ve bought a few kits before with my first baby but they were either overpriced or inferior this is the first one i believe is worth every cent my baby is less fussy since the nipples reduce gas and they are easy to clean up the bottle brush is a true pleasure to use not too stiff to damage the nipple and not too soft to be useless recommened this package to anyone 
5 5 loved these
5 5 perfect for a little boy s trips to nana s the quality is fine and it is really cute 
5 5 daughter lovea it
4 4 they do the job but i sure wish they would treat them with something to retard the yellow orange mold that grows i sense that the mold helps sell new filters as well as a separate product they sell to address that mold why not just combine both products i would pay a bit more for that and avoid having to throw out filters at the end of every winter 
5 5 these are by far the best breast milk storage bags they can only hold up to 6 ounces but the pour spout it has its a miracle it is so easy to pour the milk into a bottle i love them 
5 5 i love this playpen it is sturdy enough for my toddler and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a good playpen my only wish is that it was a little cheaper but other than that i would definitely buy it again 
5 5 loved the idea of using the toy like appearance to hide the medicine but was skeptical if it would actually work as easily as it appeared so i had to try it and it worked great money well spent on medicine not wasted 
5 4 it is much lighter than shown in the picture it is pastel and almost white looking i still love this product and got it for a great price both my daughters love it 
5 5 exactly what i needed
3 3 it fits the cradle but it s a little flimsy difficult to keep the sheets on without the edges curling up 
5 5 my guy loved his cowie the pacifier is very firmly attached and all the features are baby safe some people complain that it is smaller and lighter than they were expecting but i considered that a plus and felt safe letting it sit on my newborn s chest unlike the other pacifier holders the wubbunub is made of a velvety material i put the whole thing in a lingerie bag and ran it through the wash by the end of the spin cycle it was always dry enough to hand back to the baby the only downside is that once the pacifier is broken the whole thing is done for my guy chewed through the new one in less than 2 months 
5 5 just as described
5 5 my lo has been using these from since she was 1 month old and she still loves them now that she s 9 months old the entire pacifier is very flexible and rubbery unlike the traditional plastic backed ones which means that she also loves to gnaw on it when she s teething it s also a cinch to clean rinse it out and microwave it along with all the bottles and things we literally have 10 of them for her to use throughout the day 
1 1 disappointing i thought this monkey would help to hold the pacifier in my babies mouth instead in makes it easier to fall out because the monkey weighs it down 
5 5 i loved it 
5 5 this is my go to baby shower gift i highly recommend when my oldest was born we went through a new pacifier almost weekly because he lost them all over the house car and grocery store not with the wubba the best part about it is how easily kids are able to find it it doesn t fall to the bottom of the carseat on road trips and he never wakes up crying in the middle of the night because it s lost we ve had the same two since he was born i throw them in the wash weekly dryer and all and they re like new after 12 months it is showing slight wear where the nook is sewn to the plush i wish wubbanub would come out with a new line of plushes attached to the blue pacifiers for slightly older babies 
5 5 our baby loves it so far no complains 
5 5 i bought this for my baby nephews for christmas with a toxedo he looked really cute with it it was a good laugh 
3 4 not as heavy as i imagined it to be but still useful 
5 4 delivery delivered on time and satisfaction with products purchased
5 2 i wanted to love these pacifiers because of the 100 natural rubber and all the health benefits of this brand yet this product is a suffocation risk to my newborn as the 0 6 month size covers his nostrils completely when it s in his mouth my baby is now 8 weeks old fitting into 3 month clothing and this is still a problem natursutten please change the design or don t sell these for newborns or even three month olds 
5 5 my niece is enjoying it 
5 5 our sons loves this we can t go anywhere without it it is his comfort piece he doesn t just use the pacifier but chews on all of the legs too 
5 5 i have had excellent experienced with multiple wub a nubs bought several for each of my kids as babies replacements and extras easy to keep track of unlike a small regular pacifier plus in the crib older babies can find it and less crying for pacis at night when our oldest got too big for it we simply cut off the pacifier she still sleeps with the animal i buy these for friends having new babies they are easy to throw in the washer as well and hold up nicely 
5 5 a must for a crying baby 
5 5 baby loves them
5 5 best gift for a green bay fan that is having a girl 
5 4 the snap comes undone when you least expect it luckily i have not lost the pocket completely yet 
5 5 this pacifier and the other one almost like it are great baby stop making sounds in seconds 
5 5 perfect exactly what i was expecting :)
5 5 very high quality product 
5 5 love these bought these for my 13 year old years ago decided to use the exact pacifier for the new baby since my oldest loved them so much not to mention they are super cute shipping was fast order on february 22nd got it on the 25th thank you 
4 5 only pacifiers my baby likes just wish there was more of a selection
5 5 no complaints here my baby likes them 
3 4 great bag not too big not too small however i used this bag for cloth pads and not diapers so i cant say if it can handle a baby s stinky situations it is waterproof for the most part and easily washable 
5 3 same as any other pacifier 
5 4 i ordered the blue ones twice i love love love gumdrop pacifiers they feel nice to the touch and theyre the only ones my little boy would take from the time he was born i can never find these in walmart theyre always sold out gave 4 stars because i ordered blue twice and once i recieved pink and purple that doesnt bother me one bit but i know some people care very much about the color preference 
1 1 don t bother this came and was already marked as low battery i used it twice one the day of receipt and once the day after and then it died what a waste of my bey
5 4 great standard pacis
5 5 this one should work it s cute it s easy to find when set down it s soft and washable it s made from high quality material 
5 3 i bought the elephant paci and the dog paci the dog paci is great lays well on baby s chest the paci on the elephant is connected via a twisted curled trunk and so it s a bit ackward to get it to sit just right and keep the paci in baby s mouth 
5 2 the longhorn looks awful smooshed face not as cute as photograph here and really doesn t look like much of a longhorn at all 
5 5 excelente
5 1 way too difficult and frustrating to open i threw mine away the munchkin deluxe mesh feeders are my favorite and then the sassy ones be sure to buy the mesh feeders with the cover buy this one http www amazon com munchkin deluxe fresh feeder yellow dp b00jqsitza ref sr_1_2 ie utf8 qid 1424874593 sr 8 2 keywords mesh feeder
5 5 my granddaughter loves this 
5 5 they even have a cover for the nipple and a case for both
5 5 bought is for my friend s baby he loves it and has no clue why we re laughing 
5 5 great
5 5 we love these pacifiers my son has used them for a while and they truly glow all night simply hold them up to a light before bedtime for about 10 seconds and you can find them in the dark all night i needed some replacement ones as our old one wore out i was having trouble finding retailers that carried them an ordered this set on line the only con is that these are almost twice the price of the ones i ended up finding in a local baby chain store in town 
5 5 my daughter loves these you can prop it against something so it stays in her mouth better and she loves holding onto the stuffed animal part :)
3 5 ok
5 4 it was a gift
5 5 bien
5 4 excelent my newborn baby girl loves it probably because there s a bigger hole in the nipple compared to avent s it s also nice because you can sterilize it in the microwave by themselve without a sterilizer 
5 5 these are really great for a mustache themed party they also fit on a baby pacifier 
5 5 funny product but my daughter never liked pacifiers 
5 5 an excellent choice for our son we have tried a few different brands of pacifiers but none stayed in our son s mouth for more than a minute once we received your product and sterilized it our son immediately loved it thank you
5 5 love this
5 5 my 4 month old can get these binkies in and out of his mouth on his own due to the design if he drops this one he can find it and put it back in his mouth on his own worth every cent love these 
5 5 these are the absolute best pacifiers out there for babies and toddlers my son was an early teether first tooth at 8 weeks and he found great comfort in teething on this pacifier and pacifier edge they are high quality and last a while but i replace them when i see stress marks for safety they do bounce if they fall on the floor but it isn t a big deal in the two years we ve been using them i like that they are natural rubber but have had the latex allergy component removed from it so there is no risk of developing a latex allergy just from repeated use of them i wish they made a baby bottle nipple i searched high and low but doesn t seem this company makes baby bottle nipples i ve found rubber ones but they contain latex and i m not comfortable with that so we had to go with silicone and my son detested the texture 
5 5 hahaha great gift for my baby niece
5 5 i am extremely satisfied with this purchase these glow in the dark pacifiers have really made my life as a new mom a lot easier my son would wake up in the middle of the night because he was looking for his pacifier in his crib now when he wakes up he is able to see the pacifier and grab it since it glows in the dark i would recommend these to any parent whose baby uses a pacifier during the night 
5 5 brand new great nephew seemed to like this
5 5 good price cute colors 
1 4 very cute but did come with a chemical smell the smell went away after washing it 
5 5 my 15 year old son said these are the paci s to have for his weekend rave parties with his best friend molly i think it is very cute that he and his friends have parties where they act like babies listening to music until the wee hours of the morning the next day some good wholesome fun kids these days i swear i guess it s better than him going out and doing drugs all weekend long
5 5 these glow in the dark for quite some time can t give you an exact it s great when trying to get them down at night :)
5 5 we love it our daughter is 5 weeks old she hates most pacifiers really hate the soothies and orthodontic shaped pacifiers she would only take the mam style she is breastfed only if you have a similar baby they may like this she latched onto this paci after about 10 seconds 
5 5 we received these as a baby shower gift a novelty really but we used them for our son when he was about a month old and he loved them the ridging bumps along the gum line were an instant soother and he s refused every single other kind of binky since i ve since ordered tons of these to fill his crib and have extras throughout the house we don t leave home without them and wouldn t dream of running out we are now loyal baby fanatic pacifier customers 
5 2 my baby did not take this pacifier after using mam and the gummy it s a hit or miss with babies i guess i wish that these had worked they are so darn cute
5 3 i don t know what it is about the elephant wubbanub i purchased both this one and the blue and green dinosaur wubbanub and for some reason the dinosaur seems like it is better in every way possible i e better quality materials better made cuter softer etc this is still a good product but just not as good as some of the wubbanubs out there all of my nieces and nephews have used these pacifiers and been extremely attached to them so it is a good product however with as cute as the elephant is just be aware that there are better options out there 
5 5 only pacifier my babies would take 
5 5 at first i used the mam newborn pacifiers which my daughter also loved since about 6 weeks we have started using these they are very cute and she loves them i have tried others and she won t take them some people don t like to give these to their babies but it is reccomended now to give at bedtime to reduce risk for sids so glad i chose these they re great 
5 5 bought this for my new grandbaby they get a lot of use out of it it is such a good idea 
5 5 these work the best for my babies i breastfed and thus brand was the only ones they would take they didn t experience nipple confusion either 
5 5 my son don t like pacifiers but he sucks this one good product
5 5 daughter loved it 
5 5 every newborn needs a wubbanub
5 5 excelent
5 5 son loves his binky good price no problem s 
5 5 probably one of the best important buys of my life my child adored this bo bo because of the fit he wouldn t take any other bo bo so i had to replace this several times in addition it was a show stopper for sure lol 
5 4 these were just what i was looking for my grandson comes over and if he drops his pacifier my playful schnauzer grabs it and runs outside so i needed backups these arrived without damage because they are rubber but the packaging could have been better as the cards these are in were all bent and squashed from handling via mail 
5 3 they come as shown in the second picture i wish it was the print shown in the first photo regardless my baby loves the mam brand and fits perfectly
1 1 my baby didn t like these and neither did i they are not soft and not at all like a breast latch 
5 5 got this for a friend s baby he adores it 
5 5 these are really great just remember smallest ones are really small perfect for tiny mouth babies very new infants eventually may need the larger one or baby keeps popping it outta their mouth first tried mam when other pacifiers were too long gagged baby these were perfect 
5 5 newborn baby loves these much easier to hold and manipulate than pacifiers that have a moving handle 
5 5 perfect gift for anyone who is whiney 
5 5 amazing after going through multiple brands of formula trying to reduce excessive spit up turns out it was the tommy tippy bottles we were using i never really take the time to write a review but i had to say that these were absolutely amazing my 5 week old has now been sleeping longer stretches through the night with out any reflux issues or gas highly recommend these
5 5 good quality i like the material you can clean easily 
5 5 came in good condition and exactly what we expected
5 5 great product contoured tip fits great and comfortably into my sons mouth have tried multiple types of pacifiers and this is the only type my son will tolerate 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my baby will use 
5 5 if you are a new mom and contemplating what to put on your registry or what to buy buy this i would put this in my top 10 things i use the most as a mom the avant soothie is a great brand pacifier and since it is attached to a stuffed animal you won t lose it and they don t pop out of their mouth as easily since your baby can maneuver the animal easier that it is bigger this one is better than the elephant we don t like that one cause the trunk makes is longer and makes it harder for baby to manipulate seriously best thing ever 
5 5 i had bought a dragon for my son so i decided to get this owl for a friends baby due in march slightly bigger than the dragon my son has but its all the same really perfect as a toy and soother i ve heard many good things about this product and i recommend to everyone 
5 5 love these go tigers 
5 5 never a problem with mam i especially love how open these are help keep the area around the mouth from breaking out as bad with all those slobbers 
5 4 in my area all the hospitals give this brand out when you have a baby they aren t the best looking brand out there but they seem to be very functional at calming a new baby i was happy to see amazon offer different colors then the standard hospital issued teal and the price was really good i wish the part that sticks out of the babies mouth was smaller because when you are trying to take pictures it feels like it s covering the babies entire face the product is really great for what it is though highly recommend these for a baby girl they are extremely durable and when the baby starts cutting teeth you don t have to worry about them chewing parts of it off 
5 5 mr monkey as we call him has been one of the best investments that we ve made since our daughter was born we got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven t looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package mr monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her we ve glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it s well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother when she s fussy we just ask her to go adds find mr monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down for those with concerns about keeping it clean i just throw the whole thing in the washer we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed when it comes out of the dryer i just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it a fresh clean wubbanub ;)
5 5 it s a pacifier and it works easy to clean fits her ulubulu paci clip 
5 5 unlike the other pacifiers these are so easy to keep clean i hated the others where the silicone met with the plastic and attracted hair lint etc in the crease so hard to clean so happy with this product and will always buy these from now on 
5 5 great for an auburn baby 
5 4 this was a gift and she loved it very much 
5 5 great price for a necessary product
5 5 product does not fit the click connect 35 car seat
5 5 love love love must buy i put a thick clear tape over the speaker to lower the volume there are no volume controls this lasts and lasts and my baby is no longer fussy in bed the old wind up mobile would stop after a 2 minutes just as she was starting to enjoy it this is a great buy
4 4 seems to work well
5 4 great way to keep the water in the tub 
5 5 a perfect toy for the car seat i don t have to worry about toys falling out of his seat he bats at the toys and they make sounds and play music easy money spent 
5 5 just as described 
4 3 it s been so hard to find the right nursing bras i give this one stars for comfort and materials the cotton is soft and design cutely feminine usually i m a 36c but this bra feels big and like there s extra room in the cup strange also the cups feel a bit pointy accentuating my already big boobs just doesn t work with certain shirts 
3 5 covers so much more then the smaller types i feel much safer in the shower since the rubber mat covers so much of the tub bottom it was heavier then i expected but that is because it is a decent quality it sticks well to the tub like it should and lays flat easily i had wanted one in a prettier color but i m glad i changed my mind and got this one i think it will last a long time 
5 5 i could not live without this keeps diapers and wipes neat inside the diaper bag and is easy to grab while on the go i love the print on the inside and it is very easy to clean 
4 2 was a pain to put together and the price lowered 50 after i bought it 
5 5 i ve been using it for a month and so far i have no problem with it comfortable and absorbing well great product 
5 5 we used these at a baby shower to give the mom to be handmade personalized bibs for her baby she loved them 
4 4 great playpen but it s a little bit harder to get together than the graco that we had previously 
5 5 love these bottles 
5 5 i love this diffuser i read the reviews and purchased this one it is great i leave it running and you can t even hear it my sister has many diffusers and was shocked by how quiet this one is i have never had one before but am so glad this is the one i bought you can turn the light off and just have it run the scent i would buy this again 
5 5 these cups have consistently been the only ones that last without leaking that we have found they are great and inexpensive 
5 5 love super soft
4 4 these are about 8 5 34 x 8 5 34 which is quite small although they didn t work well for my originally intended use i do really like them as a workout accessory they are smaller softer and more absorbent than a regular handkerchief and they work very well for that purpose 
5 5 used these to announce our pregnancy to our parents on xmas eve total hit this was the perfect way to tell our family highly recommend 
5 2 snaps broke 1st wash inserts are very absorbent but the cover is super cheapy 
5 5 cute and practical
2 1 decided to try these for my daughter because they were a good deal and i liked that they came in packs of 5 unfortunately my baby wouldn t keep them in her mouth maybe because they are too small didn t get any use out of them at all stuck with the tommee tipee pacifiers which work great 
5 5 great product
4 3 overall i like the look of the glider it was what i expected however when we went to assemble it we found it didn t come with enough bolts and screws to put it together there were no directions included whatsoever in the box either my husband had to go to the hardware store 2 times for parts and we still don t have everything we need to fully assemble it 
4 3 i give the product 5 stars for ingenious product that is sensible and works i do however think they have made a grave error in their choice of battery to power it garbage batteries is all you can find when you can find them at all fix it guys 
5 5 solved the problem i had with my cats on the stove 
1 3 not really impressed and neither is baby
5 5 the product works my wife and i are happy with it we took our new born son out in chicago weather was around 35f to 40f that day we did not have any problem we put him in the car seat with the appropriate warm clothing and cover him with a fleece blanket and push him in around in the stroller with the car seat attached when we take him out from the car seat after 20 mins outside the street not in the car we can feel that it was very warm inside warm the car seat with this cover 
5 5 fits the 34 mattress 34 well nice and snugly 
4 4 confusing to set up but when it was figured out its a good bed
5 4 its as good as expected takes about 6 7 minutes for a full sterilize just beware if you are ordering from overseas like i did it comes with a 110 volts plug i had to purchase a voltage transformer from the local market for it to make it work 
5 5 purchased these in addition to the paytex drop in bottles as my son was too young to use the medium flow nipples yet they work great love these bottles also 
5 5 i looooooooooove this stroller my son was so excited very light and comfortable for him perfect to go to the park mall store even for travel its the perfect size 
4 4 i like the many pockets you can put all the things the baby needs in very useful 4 star because it doesn t look as cute as the picture the material looks cheap 
5 5 good for holding diaper prefolds in the correct shape and freeing hands to handle the diaper covers saved a lot of time especially with wiggly kids 
5 1 when i tried it with my granddaughter it poured out thru the spout and it also leaked from around the lid so bad till she was not able to use it for a training cup like it said you could i also ordered the pink one but they sent me the blue i think you should get what you pay for to be right i ordered two of them and they both are like this peggydrink yahoo com i think that the company should reminisce my money for both of them because they are of no use as a training cup and that is what i ordered peggydrink yahoo com best of luck to anyone who buys these i would like to have what i ordered to have worked 
5 5 fabulous
5 2 bought this bumper in grey this bumper has a nice grey color the bumper just seems lacking in cushion and height and the strings seem short and the material feels cheap it kinda gaps and sags here and there it s definitely not a nice luxury comfy bumper maybe it s just meant for looks my child always scrunches the bumper by standing on or kicking it it s usually all bunched and scrunched by morning i kinda feel that i wasted my money but it was the only solid grey i found that would not break the bank 
5 5 love love love this car seat transporter i purchased this for my trip to disney february 2015 and i breezed through the airport i received so many stares and compliments and people asking me where i got it it is easy to attach to a large car seat as i have the chicco a next fit and you just pop open the wheels loop the straps around the car seat and pull the handle up and you re on your way so glad i got this they didn t even make me remove it while it went through the security scanners like others mentioned however we were fine with reattaching it as we just needed to get our baby s car seat and the baby on move 
1 1 i got this as a gift for our first baby i was asked which monitor i wanted not this one and received this instead not wanting to be rude i accepted it graciously and didn t return it mistake after 2 months the video started to scramble after 4 months the stand broke off after 6 months it would decide randomly not to turn on the battery is drained after about 3 hours of use with the screen off the invisible ir leds catch my daughter s attention making it impossible for her to go back to sleep the two way audio is so scratchy and loud it scares the s out of her the green power led is so bright on the camera it lights up the entire room the picture is so fuzzy i sometimes can t tell if her eyes are open or not i get an out of range warning in my 900 square foot apartment sometimes the picture blinks upside down for a moment this thing is a piece of s 
1 1 the parent unit keeps dying even after being fully charged the lights on both units are too bright
3 3 good value for the price works fine night vision capability is good range is good set up easy battery in the receiver will not last through the night even in the standby mode works fine if you keep it plugged in also green light on side of receiver stays on all the time annoying if you like to sleep in a dark room 
5 5 all babies love this
5 4 great shape similar to breast nipple but a little hard the great thing is that the nipple is short so for my newborn it s perfect that it doesn t hit the back of her small mouth and gag her 
5 5 my son loves the glow in the dark 
5 5 great
4 5 very cute however i dont like how the binki doesn t detach like the store ones 
5 5 my grandson loved it
5 5 my baby loves these bought more to keep around the house and in the baby bag well made and in one piece no plastic smell 
5 3 love these things wubbanubs are in my top 10 must have things on my mommy list of things you need but buy the wubbanub like the cat or the lamb the elephant trunk is too long and make the paciffer floppy harder for your baby to manipulate buy one of these but not this elephantl 
5 5 so cute and soft my daughter will not take any other pacifier the wubbabub helps from paci falling out 
2 2 baby doesn t like it
5 5 very cute
5 5 gave as gift great pacifier
5 5 love this pacifier
5 5 great product easy clean up babies love the shape and texture long lasting bought like 15 of these 
5 5 great price
2 2 i like the product and had better experience with it before however this specific purchase got ruined the first time it was in a sterilizer thus wasn t used at all bummer 
5 5 perfect
5 5 i wish i found this teether sooner it s perfect i love how small it is easy to clean and my baby loves it also the price is good too 
5 5 washed and dryed nicely fabric is soft and it did not shrink 
5 3 this would work well for a window that is straight at the top and bottom our window is angled so it doesn t fit well at well we are not using this product and wouldn t recommend it for angled windows 
5 5 item was exactly as described and shipping was prompt very simple design with solid pieces so nothing can fall off or become dislodged highly reecomended 
5 5 i give these drops to my newborn daughter once a day she doesn t seem to mind the taste 
5 4 great value
5 5 perfect
5 5 so cute great service thank you
5 5 love these so much more absorbent than other brands i have tried they are also relatively comfortable i wear them all day and even through the night and only have to change once 
5 5 easy to use and super fun colors easy to clean too 
5 5 great system bought it for my son and daughter in law and hope it holds up well for them
5 5 perfect for my toddler it matches our adult set 
5 5 a classy bag worth every penny 
5 5 this swing is one of the sweetest and most brilliant things to give a new mother it offers plenty to soothe and entertain a baby and i like the fact that the legs are so stable with an active six year old in the house we want to be sure that there will be no chance of tipping i like the vast array of music and sounds of nature it s an entertainment center to snuggle up in for baby the fabrics are nice and it also boasts a canopy do they make these in adult sizes this could cure my insomnia as expected the swing has multiple speeds and can switch easily to different positions with the press of a button and adjustment good news there s an adapter so you don t always have to go in search of batteries really great gift 
5 5 why didn t i know about this earlier i saw this in a baby store and thought it was a great idea my six month old wasn t sitting up on her own yet and i was needing to start bathing her with her sister to save time this allowed her to sit up and play in the water it took up about 1 3 of our tub which allowed her sister the rest of the tub to play in it s super soft this item is rather heavy when wet we let it sit in the tub after it completing drains and then hang it up also if you fill the tub too high it kinda floats and ends up as a baby boat 
5 5 a temporary need but the travel my brest friend was wonderful for the first 5 months of my baby s life meant we could go out and i wouldn t have to worry about how to hold up my baby to feed 
5 5 i bought this for my craft room but i barely got it out of the box before my 11 year old daughter was begging for it the glass ball is so high quality and smooth and the little remote works great the colors are beautiful and i love the fade mode it provides the nicest soothing glow i ended up letting her have it for her room so i guess i ll have to buy another one 
5 5 got one as a gift and my daughter loved them so much i bought two others they are truly comfortable and work as a little easy swaddler for older kids wish i d had them with my first child love them 
5 5 good quality product
5 5 love them
4 4 colors aren t as vivid as shown and the string is very fine but it s a nice mobile 
5 5 practical bag to put things baby served me a lot and helped me a lot to recommend it 
5 5 my toddler daughter loves her new pillow she gets excited to go to bed when she sees her pillow in her crib this pillow fits perfect in the crib and for her little head 
4 3 instructions were a little difficult to read and didn t expect to have to put everything together however i am happy with it it s sturdy and pretty
5 5 absolute must
3 3 gave it as a gift as i didn t think the face was so cute 
5 5 these were an absolute lifesaver when breast feeding my second baby she had latch problems and i would not have continued breast feeding if the lactation consultant hadn t given me one now that i am pregnant for my third this was one of the first things i ordered to prepare great product would recommend to anyone 
5 5 similar to an italian made chico pram we had more than 10 years ago everything looks great and we love the flexibility 
5 5 looks great on my daughters bed 
5 5 great product with some peace of mind at bedtime 
5 5 i pirchased this decal almost two years ago and i have to say that they are still lovely very on place as well very easy to put on 
5 1 love them 
5 5 absolutely perfect we got this for my one year old daughter for her first birthday and she loves it so much we bought a second one for our almost four year old really durable would recommend to other mothers 
5 2 extremely long very awkward to wrap around body 
5 5 as soon as i gave it to my baby girl she loved it thanks baby banana 
5 5 i love the wood accent on this gate i do find that it does scratch easily especially with pets and unwieldy toddlers loaded with toys to slam and bang against the gate the auto close feature is really nice and i love that it closes quietly because during random nap times it s easy to forget there is a kid asleep and the slamming of the metal gates we have can often wake a kid up so far we are really happy with it 
5 5 i ve tried several brands and these are by far my favorite they feel amazing wash up like new i ve never had 1 leak unlike others for the price it s silly not to try them i don t think you ll be disappointed 
1 1 extremely dissapointed with this product i purchased in sept 2014 but did not begin using it until my baby arrived home on oct 20th 2014 overnight it finally h t itself completely the monitor no longer connects with the camera nothing i do works it s fried so that is the end of the slow and painful death of my levana keera it took just four months and definitely not worth the 160ish bucks i handed over for it at the beginning before any issues began i thought it was an average product i did like the camera pan feature but that s about it picture quality during the day was ok the more light the better but not helpful if your baby needs the room for sleeping night vision was very blurry i could never make out if my babies eyes were open or closed the wireless connectivity between camera and monitor has always been patchy cutting in and out often the sound would not transmit it would either cut in and out or go completely out until i would realize and have to manually reconnect or par the two also the monitor would constantly default back to the menu screen so i would glance at the monitor only to see a bunch of icons not reliable whatsoever i wasted my money and now i need to spend more doe on a new baby monitor hopefully my next purchase serves me better 
5 4 my grandbaby is having fun w the soothie pacifier wubbanub monkey my only complaint it is pretty pricey the stuffed animal is not a very good quality 
5 5 how freaking cute is this dragon i had seen the dogs and cats and bears but i wanted something a little more interesting what is most awesome is that he has had this type of paci since being in the hospital so he loves the paci iand the dragon he gets excited every time we pull this out and he loves to suck on the tail 
5 5 these pacifiers are the cutest 
5 5 my friends baby will look so cute when sucking on this 
4 4 i rated this 4 stars only because i don t think it is good for my grand daughter for newborn use the nipple is a tad bit big and she likes the smaller ones she was 7 lbs at birth she will use it when she gets a bit bigger and then i would rate it 5 stars it is easy to use and find and stays in place 
3 3 purchased this monitor a year ago and the sound quit working about 4 mo after purchase all other components are still working but it is somewhat difficult without sound 
2 5 i got this at walmart last night for 34 regular price it is fully expanded and is about 5 inches thick when it fully expands be sure to take of cover so the mattress can expand naturally originally i didn t want to buy it because i thought it would be too soft which is not ideal for crib mattresses but i decided to give it a try and return it if i didn t like it its not too soft by any means but not rock hard either i honestly think its perfect i love the quality would buy again 
5 5 great product mixes well baby loves it 
5 5 beautiful and well made it fit my daughter who was 4 1 2 months old at the time comfortably without leaving marks perfect for christmas 
5 5 my 4 month old absolutely loves this we have many toys for her and this one is our favorite she can jump on her own vs not being able to scoot across the floor in the other toys yet we love it 
5 5 my poor baby is cutting 4 teeth on top this teether really helps with the soreness in her gums it s her favorite by far 
5 5 amazing product color is vibrant soft but durable material 
5 5 so far my breastfed baby will take this bottle i never found a bottle that my first son would take 
5 5 snug fit make sure it fits your brand
5 5 this product is great and saves lots of time in the kitchentotally recomended
5 4 fits perfectly went on easy and no bubbles 
5 5 always a great gift 
5 5  1 baby products
3 3 the nightlight is cute when off but once it s turned on the light shines through to display a poor paint job it s also a heavy nightlight and can teeter over if not balanced well on the plug it did work well for quite some time once it stopped working we removed the elephant and use it as a stand alone room decoration 
5 5 i used this the other day at the mall my 1 year old is sick right now and only wants to be held this worked great he s is a 25 ounder and this definately held him up and released a lot of pressure and discomfort from my wrists if worn properly its very comfortable i thought it would hurt my shoulder with the wait but it didn t i just need to learn or practice putting it on for a first timer i struggled a bit just to get it straight and to figure out how to put it on so that the rings wouldn t hurt him also the rings are metal super sturdy this was a great invenstment i just wonder why i took so long to get one took me a while to find one that would last a while sense my kiddo is not an infant anymore this is a perfect item to get if your baby isn t so much a baby anymore recommend 
5 5 this video baby monitor is awesome great picture day or night pretty good range nice zoom feature and you can move the camera all around lets you talk to the baby and even play 3 different lullabies great price for the quality i would definitely recommend this camera to new parents 
1 2 a bit thin my son never took to it 
5 5 love this pump i used it with my first four years ago and recently had another baby insurance now covers breast pumps so i thought i d give another a shot since replacing the filters can be a pain i got the medela in style hoping to be wowed after weeks of using that and having lack luster results in the amount i was able to get i m going right back to this one i just ordered replacement tubes since mine have been sitting collecting dust for a few years now fully recommend this the filters are the only downside in my experience but keeping a decent back up supply has far outweighed that in my experience customer service was always easy to work with too for me 
5 4 i have the rainforest one from fisher price i loaned it out i got this one due to the picture showing it slid under the bed no it has to be disassembled first on the plus side its bright and fun wish it played music when movement activated it cant wait toi get my rainforest one back 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 great grandbaby loves it 
4 4 i love love love this booster the only reason i gave 4 stars rather then 5 because the straps seem to twist a lot and i have to fix them but its a small thing to deal with for a safe car seat that is made so well i am very happy with the purchase and love britax 
5 5 perfect fit nice and sturdy as advertised
5 5 i bought these to have extra a little pricey but a great product 
5 4 this bag is pretty small but perfect for daycare cubbies the bottle straps inside are handy very sturdy and well made 
5 5 love this perfect for traveling or putting in your bed my baby used this from 3 to 6 months and got use to it so much that when i transitioned her to her crib she wouldn t sleep we went on two vacations and she slept in it fine 
5 4 this bag is very beautiful and doesn t look like a diaper bag at all the nylon material seems very durable and easy to clean bottle pockets on both sides of the bag are insulated i put on of the bottles for example and you can see it on one of the pictures i use playtex drop in bottles in front of the bag there are two pockets the lower one can fit full size wallet and there still will be some space on the side the top pocket could be perfect for cell phone or small items i would use it for my personal things and to give you an idea how big it is on one of the pictures i put facial wipes mustela in it once the wipes are in i am able to close the pocket but the top part of the wipe s container sometimes gets on the way also zipper on this particular pocket is hard to work with what i mean is that you will need to use two hand to close it i think it because the placed zipper so high to the top of the bag on the back of the bag there is a zipped compartment for changing pad it s a standard size for skip hop brand and i believe no bigger or smaller than most others on the inside there are four pockets that are the same size you might see from the picture that pockets are reinforced which i love because it hold things more secure it doesn t have bottle pockets on the inside of the bag also i like the color of the inside its not black so you can find things easier but not too light to show dirt the stroller hooks can be placed on the inside of the bag when not in use my other favorite part is the bag has zipper on top i don t have to worry about everything flying out of the bag when i throw it in the car the stroller hooks can be used even when the bag is closed another big plus the hardware is color of yellow gold and as much as i dislike the yellow gold this particular tone doesn t bother me the handles are very comfy overall i would highly recommend this bag to anybody who like me is looking for a diaper bag that doesn t look like it it is very roomy even if it doesn t look like it i was between this one and storksak skip hop holds same amount or even more and looks nicer but i do have my concerns zippers would ne first one i noticed when you place something in the front pocket it a little easier to close i wish the handles were from nylon material instead of faux leather would last longer the same can be said about details i am not sure how long the faux leather will last i also wish skip hop would add a shoulder strap but it s just personal preference 
5 5 quick shipping easy to assemble looks like great fun
4 5 i thought it might be too thin but is is awesome a bit more generous in cut than the official stokke sheet easier to put on because it s very slightly stretchy and much much much softer i try to wash this and get it back on the bed rather than using my other cotton stokke sheet i have 2 now and will probably get more no issues with fading or losing their shape though i ve only had them a few months so far 
5 5 this is such an awesome thing to have during potty training brilliant diono it is super easy to install and fits the carseat perfectly 
5 5 got it to use for air for my dog to keep her cooler in the summer works good 
2 2 worked like a charm for the first month but then quickly started bursting sections this is not meant to last only used with light weight lunch nothing heavy so i would think it would last longer 
5 5 love it
5 5 this is the best system ever 
3 3 it s not what i expected it really does not swing it just glides 
1 1 it does not work this is nothing less than a scam i lost all trust for this company unbelievable who the heck rated this crap 5 stars anyway probably someone who got paid to do that the battery cover didn t close the static is ridiculous and you can t even hear anything even when my baby is moving a ton 
5 5 my baby loves them 
1 2 it was almost impossible to open up the lasso tag to pull out the tag that was blocking the battery once i got it synced with my iphone 5c i didn t feel like it was working properly i attached the lasso tag to my car keys when i got within 10 feet a beep went off it should work up to 50 feet it said but that s not true for me really don t like it and hope to return it for full refund 
5 5 wow do i wish i had this back when i had kids i mean i lived pushing strollers around to the park shopping church library you name it the skip hop grab and go stroller saddlebag is the right size grabs on to any stroller and it is super sturdy and durable plus it is thick and insulated one thing i loved is that the interior color is very light dark interiors have moms looking and looking for those items also many pockets for all of those items and water bottles too very happy with this and will make a great gift for any busy mom i am sending it to my niece who is having twins 
5 3 cute light lasted just for a short time probably needs new battery if that works it s a good purchase 
5 5 genial
5 5 this product is a life saver our little girl had trouble settling down to sleep she would either cry herself to sleep or have to sleep on moms breast she also was a colic baby and the the dr recommended this product she said and i agree that it is good to keep her at an angle also that it is like a hammock and keeps the baby wrapped tight so if you swaddle her with a blanket and then put her in it keeps her nice and snuggled it really worked and she has slept in it ever since first in our room then moved to her own room for our peace and quiet the only negative is that she didn t like the vibration but that may be just her also with a newborn i removed the rattle and wish i could remove the straps the baby is in there nice and tight it wasn t really necessary to strap them in also the rocking is very helpful and it is very easy to rock 
5 5 i bought this to use for my grand daughter and i also bought the doterra diffuser i like this one better it seems to diffuse better i would still buy the doterra but if it were between the two i would opt for the riverock 
3 3 it keeps the door about an inch from closing but cannot designate the width of the opening which is what i was hoping for 
5 5 great product these organic reusable wash cloths are so soft and gentle they are brilliant to use on the sensitive skin of your little ones no need to spend out on disposable wipes now so this product is so economical and better for the environment they wash up well and maintain their softness i highly recommend these great cloths not only for babies use but also for adults too especially those with sensitive skin 
5 5 one of the cheapest on the market and of good quality especially for a kid 
5 5 excelente producto recomendado 100 
5 5 i had purchased the medela disposables after i ran out of those i ordered these because the price was lower turns out these are wayyy more comfortable absorbent and look better in my purse than any other brands i ve tried 
5 4 great nice prints
5 1 sometimes they work sometimes they don t so no they aren t good 
1 1 the flap on the base is not wide enough to actually secure under the electronics very disappointed 
5 5 amazing 
5 5 best pacifiers you can get for breastfeeding babies we haven t had any issues with nipple confussion we love thay thay come in sterilizing boxes these are the only pacifiers my baby will take and it has not affected his willingness or desire to breastfeed 
5 5 my daughter is exclusively breastfeed and these don t affect her feedings we love them and everyone loves how cute they are 
5 1 these are not silicon like the ones sold in stores they are latex 
5 4 so cute 
5 5 these are the cutest pacifiers on the planet 
5 5 perfect for my boy
5 5 these bottles are amazing my baby was exclussively breastfed until 3 months when i had to return to work i was very worried because i have heard from other moms that their babies did not want to breastfeed after introducing bottlefeeding we tried avent and nuk and he woudn t drink out of these the mam bottles have not caused nipple confussion he is now 6 months old and he still breastfeeds when i am at home and bottlefeeds while i m at work the only issue we have had is that if you are not careful when assembling them they may leak when warming up the bottle just take your time when putting the bottles together make sure they are assembled tightly and correctly and this will not happen 
5 5 my daughter loves her wubba nubs i am going to have an all out war to get her to give them up they are great as they are not so easily lost like a plain pacifier but your child will imprint on these and clutch it constantly for comfort and love this little elephant is particularly cute another favorite is the dragon style 
5 4 pretty cool glow in the dark if charged before bedtime easy to find at night 
5 5 my daughter loves these 
5 5 i love tommee tippee brand and their pacifiers hold up very well to my expectations they don t glow very well in the dark but that s not why i bought them i bought them because we were using the tommee tippee bottles and she would no longer take the hospital pacifiers amazon is one of the best prices and love that we get two day free shipping with prime especially since i can t find the size we need in any stores 
5 5 newborn loved these she s one month old now and still only wants these 
5 5 the mam air silicone pacifier are very good 
4 4 great product overall only issue i had was that when i recieved it the case was cracked and broken front and back if i had bought this as a gift i would have been extremely upset about this fact not a very good thing to ship in a cheap envelope 
5 5 love them very fast shipping
5 5 wubbanubs as a whole are wonderful my granddaughter can manipulate them fairly well at 6 weeks fyi that the confetti puppy is a little fatter rounder than the giraffe and pink bear so it does not stay placed as well as the giraffe and pink bear due to its top heaviness on a whole these have been very helpful 
5 4 my baby boy loves these but they came in the wrong color if that matters 
5 5 we have tried all the major brands of pacifier and these are the only ones my 3 month can keep in her mouth they are easy to clean and don t get water trapped in them like some others we have tried a bonus is that all the designs are cute for girls including the blue ones 
5 5 just as described cheaper than walmart too 
5 4 can you sterilize pacifiers too
5 5 molded from a single piece of rubber makes these easy to wash and sterilize 
5 5 thank you so much it s just what i wanted it actually came earlier than expected which was great thank you again i will definitely be purchasing more from this seller 
5 2 night vision doent really work and you can hardlt see the image with the light on
5 5 cute my toddler loves this in the tub 
5 5 i bought one as a baby shower gift and ended up buying one for my daughter because they were so cute the rubber is a bit harder than i expected but if anyone remembers hitting their heads or backs on the metal faucet when they were little and how much that hurt this will fix that problem it pours water beautifully out of harry the hippo s mouth bathtime is now her favourite time of the day 
5 5 absolutely love this mirror for the car large view and very easy to attach the pivot part attached to the mirror is the best part you line up the pivot attachment to the headrest and swivel the mirror accordingly to view your baby i would definitely purchase again 
5 5 we had owned the city mini single in 2011 and three children later upgraded to this bad boy we adore this stroller it fits our 3 1 2 year old and 2 year old on one side sitting together so it s plenty deep easy to navigate a little harder to close up compared to the single city mini but still easier than every other stroller highly recommend 
1 1 had for only 3 months and it now turns itself off in the middle of the night will be contacting amazon for a full refund 
5 5 our son has always been a good sleeper he would wake up to feed throughout the night and then go right back to sleep he loved being swaddled and as time went on he slept better and better he would average 5 8 hours before waking up to feed i was very nervous about not swaddling him anymore and wanted to try to transition him out of yhe swaddle before he began to roll over at about 14 weeks i started to try different methods of putting him to sleep without swaddling him i tried a sleep sac keeping his arms out of the swaddle one arm at a time it was no use i asked about what i could do on a group i m in on facebook and this product was recommended to me i was skeptical at first and the material looked very warm i used the merlins magic sleep suit with a lighter sleeper and it was pretty much a seemless transition he didn t get overheated in it and he has access to his hands now this product is great i ve been using it for 2 weeks now and he s sleeping ever better than when he was swaddled i highly recommend it for those who are looking for a good transition from being swaddled 
5 4 i really like these pump parts they seem very comparable in quality to medela parts however i noticed they are made of 6 plastic and i ve read that this type of plastic can leach toxins into food medela parts are made with 7 plastic which can leach hormone disruptors so either way you can t win 
5 5 baby loves this she is able to grab and shake on her own 
5 4 works for my 6 month old he loves the rubber nipple also just for chewing 
5 5 love these bottles my grandson took to these with no problems 
5 5 fantastic he s a tall kid and pulls himself up on everything but this still contains him i love the gate piece too 
5 5 good
5 5 my son loves it a much better option than my small metal necklace
4 4 this isn t the best swing in the world i would actually have rated it a little lower if my baby didn t love it so much he doesn t care about the things that bother me we purchased this swing after the motor stopped working on his old swing which was a fisher price swing in the same style as this one just a different theme and it was several years old the old swing was perfect sturdy great performance although it did go through batteries pretty quickly apparently these swings aren t made as well as they once were the plastic is thinner and seems cheap the frame of the swing rocks as he swings not enough to turn over just enough to be annoying to me the mobile was made wrong in the factory and would not spin all the way around because two of the arms were pointing in the wrong direction and wouldn t pass the swing bar so i had to forcefully bend them down which marred the plastic but at least my baby can enjoy the mobile now i will say that the batteries are lasting much longer in this swing and it has the bonus option of plugging in to an outlet which is handy the theme is also cute the important thing is that it seems to be safe and my baby loves it which is why i gave it four stars despite my complaints about it if i had it to do over though i probably would have spent the extra money to get a better swing 
5 4 it is easy to use but they lose suction power too soon 
1 1 my wife and i purchased 2 of these exact carseats from our local babies r us store last friday 2 13 15 and installed them into both of our vehicles for our son we like the style the features and most importantly our son liked it too because it was comfortable for him and his long legs the seat works perfectly when not installed or just installed into the vehicle however as soon as our son sat on the seat we couldn t tighten it at all in either vehicle too this is not a fluke it is a design flaw as soon as your child sits on the seat the weight of the child compresses the bottom portion of the seat and causes the straps below to prevent it from being tightened our son is a lightweight too he s only 24 pounds at 3 years old we called graco customer service and they told us that because the seat straps cannot be tightened it is unsafe and should be returned to bru we spent our hard earned money over 400 with tax on 2 of these seats when neither of them worked and we spent extra time and gas to return the items summary do not purchase this product it is unsafe when installed 
5 5 this is perfect for booster seats because there s no back the texture reminds me of a floor mat that is just rubber it will be so easy to clean for car seats with backs i recommend the brica seat guardian because it protects the whole seat http www amazon com brica seat guardian car protector dp b00b7m7bkw ref pd_sbs_ba_2 ie utf8 refrid 1bqj37yscthaxg8c6cs4
5 5 standard tray 
5 5 gud
5 3 this is in no way a fault of the product but please know that even though the faa s own website recommends this product many airline staff are not familiar with it and will tell you that you cannot use it since it 34 intrudes 34 on another passenger s space by wrapping around the back and linking under their tray table they may tell you it s a safety issue with the tray table etc even though it isn t true then you will find yourself on a flight with a incorrectly it should be fine and approved on all aircraft useless product no way to restrain your child speak with your airline before flying get to the airport early speak with the gate agent and alert the flight attendants immediately upon boarding that you will be using the device better yet print out the link here http www faa gov passengers fly_children from the faa site that mentions this product 
5 5 i bought these for my 6 month old and she took to them right away will purchase these again 
5 5 we ve had these bed rails for 4 years and still going strong 
5 5 the side zipper can be somewhat awkward to zip and unzip but otherwise this is a perfect hoodie i have been wearing it in addition to my winter coat here in chicago makes me feel like baby stays warmer since i don t have a coat big enough to zip around her i know this will be perfect on it s own on the cooler spring and fall days too worth every penny 
5 4 not recommended for using just sooooo cute 
5 5 too cute 
5 3 enormous it s practically the size of a real bathtub my 3 year old child made a house out of the box it came in it s that big my baby is 6 weeks and haven t used it yet as it s too much of a hassle as it s so big just using sink for now 
1 3 the buttons keep popping off the window from time to time it s not horrible just a nuissance 
5 5 my 3 year old loves this because now he can go to the bathroom like daddy 
5 5 perfect size and shape for a changing pad the strap kinda gets in the way and you will more than likely never use it
5 5 perfect backpack for a toddler to carry 
1 2 broke after a few uses 
5 5 this thing is a god send from infancy both my children responded well to white noise for sleeping and it helped save many a night of sleep for us now that my youngest is a toddler we still use the white noise we use the ocean one which helps drown out any sounds we may be making in the living room tv vacuum etc when he goes to bed we also use the projector part as a nightlight we bought this one because it plugs in we had one before that used batteries and it ate through them so fast and then we used our phones but it would run down the battery and someone would call in the middle of its use and wake the baby so having one that plugs in and is separate from our phones was imperative i can t say enough good things about this product it saved our sanity during our baby s first year and beyond 
5 5 love love love these cards wish i had known earlier about them
5 5 very good
5 5 my 17 month old loves her new sippy cups 
5 3 good for secondary car seat gets the job done but you can definitely tell the difference in quality compared to our 100 one straps are thin and floppy buckle feels kind of cheap 
5 5 i bought this for my premature sons crib it is perfect babies should not have soft mattresses i recieved the product on time and it had no smell to it it is firm but not uncomfortably firm my baby is 6 months old now and likes the mattress it is sturdy and good construction and will last a while i am happy i bought it and will recommend it 
5 5 excellent
5 5 the suction cups work on smooth surfaces my wall is bumpy so i used velcro instead the size is perfect for toddlers not sure why so many people say it is too small mine is accurate to the picture and my 3 year old loves his new potty so much he used it before i could put it on the wall haha made me hold it because he was too excited to wait so happy i bought this wish there was an option like this for girls ;)
4 3 this towel is so cute and made really nice however i bought it for my 4 year old and its sadly not as big as it looks in the pictures 
5 5 love it is very soft and has alot of air cushion fits perfect with our quinny buzz xtra stoller can t wait for our baby to use it 
5 4 i ve yet to wash it for the full potential of absorbing however it already out does all the other diapers in my current stash my 18 month old daughter is an extremely heavy wetter she has slept 6 hours before waking from being wet it s usually about 1 1 2 to 2 hours i know as i continue using i m going to really love it i bought it based on reviews about night time use i wish i had bought 2 update now that i ve been using this for awhile i love it she has slept 11 hours without waking to be changed i m going to buy another one that way i ll have one for the night the other one is hanging out to dry i line dry all my diapers update i have been using for a year now still works great with a wool cover i have 3 in my stash now not as soft now i still put a bamboo insert in next to her skin i also put another charcoal bamboo insert underneath then cover with a wool cover 
5 5 very cute kitty isn t my daughters favorite but good addition to her collection 
5 5 i purchased this bear for a friend whose granddaughter had a baby who was not sleeping the sound of this bear sounds very much like the womb sound the bear is very well made and a nice size the baby isn t sleeping much better but this doesn t mean that another baby would react much differently 
5 5 these wubbanubs are like crack to my daughter they are easy for little hands to grab onto and when they get dirty i throw them in the washer they wash great i ve even stitched a new pacifier into one when it got wore out 
5 5 my nephew looks adorable with this pacifier 
1 3 hard to open cheap construction
5 5 adorable received them so quickly a 
5 5 best pacis out there
4 3 this was pretty cool we used it at first but now we just use the plastic case that comes with the mam s i guess it just seems cleaner 
5 4 i think this a great game
5 5 absolutely adorable on my little guy these are his favorite too the mustache is a great teether material and the nipple is orthodontic and made from food grade silicone which is fantastic so it s a pacifier and teether in one buyers beware though i ve ordered like 10 of these over the last year and had to return several because they were knock offs the name brand sold by fctry are the only ones i keep they are much better made thicker plastic base which seems much safer for my little guy 
5 4 wasn t compleyely what i exspected but love it still
5 5 funny binky
5 5 another great avend product 
5 5 this is very convenient for the diaper bag when trying to locate the pacifier 
5 5 only ones my daughter will use 
5 5 funny for the baby
1 1 i bought a different version of this same style and maker for a baby shower gift it was recalled on the news a few months later around nov 2014 for containing lead in the paint 
5 5 perfect love these cant live without them
5 5 my son took very well to these pacifiers 
5 5 we love love love our elephant can t go to bed without this thing 
5 1 they barely glow in the dark ended up getting the mam glow in the dark pacifier much much better 
5 5 fast shipping exactly as expected
5 5 love these pacifiers unlike some of the ones that are specially shaped for orthodontic reasons such as nuk these ones are the same at any orientation which makes it easy for a baby to put it back in his her mouth i tried another brand and it was frustrating for my child because she would sometimes put it back in upside down with this one it s impossible to do that 
5 5 the best
5 5 excellent 
5 5 these are the same pacifiers my son was given in the hospital and he would not take any other kind of pacifier i only wish they were a little easier to put a pacifier clip on because they bounce when dropped or thrown across the room by an 8 month old 
5 5 only pacifiers my son will take 
5 5 thanks
5 5 very good product
5 4 my grand daughter like them
5 5 baby loves it 
5 5 perfect baby gift every time
5 5 great product
5 5 all good no complains vendor delivered fast
1 2 colors are not as shown 
5 5 all good no complains vendor delivered fast
5 5 my baby loves this puppy
5 5 super soft and just what we needed
5 5 great you can see them in the dark 
5 5 i got these for my niece since my dog ate one of hers and she liked it 
5 5 excellent
5 5 got it on time and love it we used them in some of his pic s all so 
5 5 love this 
5 5 my little girl loves these it was the only bottle she would take out of about 5 other brands we tried it is the closest thing to the real deal i have found highly recommend to anyone who is having to supplement their breast milk it doesn t seem to cause nipple confusion like others do my little one can switch from breast to bottle with no problem i can t give more than 5 stars but i d like to love love love this product oh and bonus having the binkies my baby girl wouldn t take any other binky not even the ones they give at the hospital but she takes these and it has allowed this mamma extra sleep 
5 5 my baby s comfort toy 
3 4 came a few days late and not the same color as advertised but cute
4 3 the only thing that i didn t like is that is not easily replaceable the pacifier attach
5 5 perfect for my grandson the nice thing about these is that they are easy for a little one to grab and find especially when they wake at night 
5 5 my daughter used these up to 3 months absolutely loved them just hard to keep them in the baby s mouth besides that frustration if trying to keep the bink in the mouth excellent product 
5 5 when my baby was about a month old i got her this because she loves to spit her binky out constantly i figured with it being 34 weighted 34 that it would help some it did and it was so cute to see her snuggled up to him even out of her mouth him because my husband named him geoffrey like the toys r us giraffe we don t use it as much now that she s almost 4 months old 
5 5 love them
5 5 these pacifiers are great the best part is that if my son drops it when sleeping he won t get a mark on his face if he accidently sleeps on it he also doesn t get that ring around his mouth from sucking to hard like other pacifiers plus i like think its cute to see the little hole in his mouth when he sucks it s also super easy to throw in the hot water to sterlize 
5 5 so cute
5 4 both my children love these pacifiers
5 3 my son doesn t take any pacifier i ve tried like 6 different ones he liked this one but maybe for a minute or so and then spits it out
5 5 i love seeing these pacifiers at night in the dark 
5 5 newborns favorite 
1 1 the item i received was obviously used the box had been opened and the plastic on the product was smudged when buying something to sterilize and clean items for your baby it s really important that the product hasn t been used 
5 3 the sucker part is long gagged my baby
5 5 came just as advertised my son loves his monkey and his dog wouldn t take any other type of pacifier he is always carrying it around by the monkey tail have had no problems with these for the past 11 months and he still loves them 
5 5 purchased as a baby shower gift used for one of the games then gave to mommy great item for both game and gift 
4 3 the product is good i mostly use it when i go out but my son doesn t like it too much it leaves a mark around his mouth
5 5 perfect for newborns
5 5 new grand baby on way
5 5 love it
5 2 great pacifiers selection wasn t so great though gave me all sports themed and i have a little girl and we don t do sports lol guess we will just use these at home
5 1 i was so disappointed with this product i hadn t considered it would have been made with such low quality especially for the price i honestly thought it was a joke i received a plush toy that resembles something that would come with a child s fast food meal only with a pacifier sewed into it s mouth this product makes sanitizing the pacifier a chore and washing the plush toy separately impossible if considering purchasing this product i suggest making your own find a low quality stuffed animal around the size of your hand and sew a binky into it s mouth 
5 5 was well made and 34 baby safe 34 met expectations 
1 1 very disappointed this is the item i ordered but not what i received no white polka dots and no red handle 
5 4 pacifiers only glow in the dark for a short time so it doesn t really help you in the middle of the night when you are trying to find it in the crib my son loves them though 
5 5 this is the only binky my son will use 
3 3 i like these pacifiers but the design came off quickly 
3 3 worked fine but baby liked nuk pacifiers better
5 5 love
5 5 great buy thank you
5 5 excellent for sterilization and drying
5 4 this pacifier is adorable it s cute soft small enough that it poses no risk to sleeping infants and is easily grasped by tiny hands my daughter has never been a fan of pacifiers but she loves the caterpillar the pacifier has also come in handy during teething it would be nice if the pacifier part were detachable and replaceable 
5 4 all ok
4 1 far too strongly scented my son doesn t mind them a bit but i find the smell off putting and this is coming from someone who has a newborn and is therefore used to baby smells 
5 5 i honestly can t imagine how there are any less than 5 star reviews though i suppose all babies are different i picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby wow was i irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago my daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn t fit her tiny mouth tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms i knew we had found magic due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend i m not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can t even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time plus it s so large that it s very difficult to lose tho not impossible i promise the only downside is that the plush portion isn t machine washable you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically 34 clean 34 however i can t imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so i can t hold that against the manufacturer i m a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about 6 99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping it s still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she s miserable without one of these babies close by she pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost all three during one infamous ikea trip where she s was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since i last stocked up i m telling you short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama much like my happiness dictates my husband s sleeping arrangements trust me these are the binkie to have and darn their cute too 
3 4 huge fan of these however the elephant doesn t lay on baby s chest as nicely as some of the others doesn t stay put very well 
5 5 my son loves it great service
5 5 love
4 5 i hate to admit it but i have a baby fetish i like to suck on a pacifier etc pretty harmless tis pacifier is well made i think it could be a lot better thesurrounding plastic part is horizontal to the face and lips i think if it were curved to fit the shape of the lips it would be much better there are many nerve endings o the lips and face if the pacifier were curved it would simulate the face and lips more i look forward to 5 000 for product design john honolulu
5 5 so cute
5 5 as anyone would know these are essential for a newborn or infant these were made with a good design baby proven i would recommend this product 
5 5 so pretty and cute baby seems to enjoy them avent stands for quality 
5 5 all ok
5 4 it was smaller than expected but very cute love it 
5 5 great all in one pacifer teether and its washable all of it she loves to chew on tbe legs and the antlers i dont worry about the beans coming out bc they are sown into their own little compartment we have a different wub for each diaper bag and the crib most of the time she just likes to hold onto it thanks for this product 
5 4 this pacifier is adorable it s cute soft small enough that it poses no risk to sleeping infants and is easily grasped by tiny hands my daughter has never been a fan of pacifiers but she loves the caterpillar the pacifier has also come in handy during teething it would be nice if the pacifier part were detachable and replaceable 
5 5 just omg my niece looks hilarious with this lots of curious looks from people but my niece loves it definitely will purchase again 
5 4 love the mam pacifier s purchased for a baby shower and the baby loved them and mom was so happy slightly more expensive than other pacifiers but great product 
3 3 daughter didn t like the shape but seemed to be made well though 
4 4 very excited to try this out with my god son he was born premie 4lbs and this is the pacifier they have him hoping he takes to it again my one problem is levi is a lot smaller than he looks in pictures my one concern is if it detaches or not the company says it does yet parents say it doesn t i haven t opened it yet so i m not sure if it doesn t that s not a good thing but hey if he loves it so be it 
5 1 tried it with both my kids they push it out in seconds i was very excited about this and i realize different kids have different preferences but mine just didn t like them when you wash them in the dishwasher or sanitize them the color looks very weird 
5 5 perfect for our preemie the little bit of weight of the monkey helped him keep the pacifier in when he couldn t do it on his own and gave him something to cuddle as he drifted off made transitioning him from breastfeeding to pacifier easy too as he had something to hold after he snuggled with mommy 
5 5 i love this product i was nursing my 2 week old endlessly playing the human pacifier and had tried another newborn pacifier without much luck got this for my little guy and he already loves it my nipples and sanity thank you wubbanub 
5 4 i bought these in the hopes they d be a better alternative to the regular nuk orthodontic ones which collect water in the nipple and have mold and mildew issues these are all one piece are easy to clean and don t collect water in the nipple my daughter liked them but i wish they came in a larger size too also they collect every little piece of lint other than that they are great now that we are on to the size 2 nuks we can t use these anymore 
2 2 ok i wouldn t buy again
5 5 the only pacifier that she can keep in her mouth 
5 5 adorable baby was wearing it at a baby shower and all of the women swooned ;)
5 5 my son loves his wubbanub s he ll spot it across the room come running for it 
5 4 the baby s mother loved hello kitty so we made this purchase for her the baby used these pacifiers for several months they were cute and obviously the baby enjoyed them that is all that counts i would make this purchase again if i had another lover of hello kitty 
1 1 came late and baby won t suck on it the end is to big
5 5 by far the best pacifiers we have used 
5 5 my baby loved it 
2 3 my 3 month old nephew hates it and will not use it but i cannot see anything wrong with the device itself i tested it out and it reads accurately i guess its much bigger then the other pacifiers my sister bought for him so he will refuse it 
4 4 good pacifier great nipple length and face guard baby doesn t like the teardrop shape of the nipple though i wish the nipple is a straight column instead of teardrop shaped 
5 3 it s a good quality product 
5 5 a great item and love it 
5 3 baby won t take this pacifier or any pacifier 
5 5 perfect bo bo s would love to order more in the future 
5 5 cute and useful he hasn t gotten the hang of it yet but i m sure he ll love it when he does 
5 5 my second gift for my grandson
1 1 i got what i paid for i suppose but this was very cheap the pacifiers had to be cutout and use tape maybe we didn t use it at the shower after all 
5 5 daughter loves the bug we bring it everywhere she now chews on the legs what ever keeps her happy 
5 5 as described
5 5 my son loves these and after taking his bottle away at 1 year these were the only thing that saved us at night time they are strong perfect for little fingers most definitely soothing 
5 5 wonderful product for a great price 
5 1 my baby only takes these soothie for 0 3months now that she is 7 months and she s got one tooth out we purchased this my baby doesn t take it at all and it keeps coming off her mouth i think it is much more harder for her to suck i understand why the material has got to be harder and thicker for older babies but if they don t take it at all what is the point at all 
5 5 excellent
3 2 will fit 1 pacifier 2 if you cram them in there this is extremely difficult to open but it does stay shut just being thrown into a purse or diaper bag and jostled around 
5 5 love our wubbanubs she played with them and didn t suck on them after we ordered more but the first one she had that we lost was awesome definitely recommend
5 5 the only pacifier my baby will take
5 5 we love wubbanub s this is a cute holiday one that can be use year round they keep the paci in the babies mouth and give them something to hold ob to best baby shower gift ever 
5 5 love these pacifiers easy to clean good quality 
5 1 don t like them
5 5 this was a gift shipped to another address recipient love it but i didn t get to see it in person 
4 3 nice product but did not work for my son drops it every time can t seem to hold on to it well 
5 5 i ordered this for my baby before he was born turns out he won t take a pacifier but this is really cute love it wish he would take it 
1 1 newborn and 0 3 months are not the same size 0 3 is noticeably larger i tried those with my 2 week old but they were too large for him i was lead to believe i was ordering newborn i did not need another set of 0 3 very disappointed 
5 3 does a good job at holding the pacifier inside and protecting it from lint and dirt the problem i have with this is the hanger it does not latch or anything so i find that it frequently falls off of places that we try to hang it for example this will not work for hanging on a strap of a diaper bag and it can have a difficult time staying on a car seat carrying handle 
5 5 love love love these but wish it was available in the 3 month as well
5 4 great binkys 
5 4 one day our kid realized he could protest the administration of medicine and to our surprise he was quite good at rejecting it after struggling a bit and failing to be able to use the syringe plungers that come with the over the counter medicines we purchased several products to try something else this was the best out of the ones that we tried and we have been using this exclusively for several months since you can use this as a syringe to suck up the medicine from the bottle but for something like motrin where the dosage is a small volume i found it more accurate to use the one that comes in the motrin box and then transfer it to the mini medicator this method does require you to be careful and can make a mess so my only knock on this product would be that it is not easy to transfer medicine to it if you do not use it as a syringe after squirting medicine all over the kitchen in the middle of the night one time i have gotten the prep down now as far as administering medicine it works quite well the shield prevents spilling back out and the design shoots the medicine off to the sides of the mouth which does not choke our kid if he s on his back like the out of the box syringes would 
5 5 easy for the little ones to hold our little one loves it 
5 1 this is my first review ever the hospital gave me this pacifier when my son was born he loved it 18 months later he went to the dentist because he had developed a significant overbite the dentist new exactly what pacifier he was using and i couldn t believe it i said 34 no way the hospital gave it to me it has to be good 34 he said no they give them to you because they get them for free i was so mad no one in my family has a problem with any kind of overbite so i knew it had to be from this pacifier i have three boys all under the age of 6 and he is the only one that used a pacifier and he is the only one that has an overbite my dentist told me to switch to mam it is the only pacifier that will not affect the baby s teeth so i switched him over it took about a week or so but he finally took to it how i switched him over he only gets his pacifier at nap and bedtime so as a treat i gave him the new mam during the day he didn t love it right away but anything was better than nothing i always put both the old and new one in the bed with him then finally about a week later i took away the old one and gave him only the mam at nap and bed and he did fine i hope this helps :)
5 5 my son is a cowboy this pleases me muchly 
5 5 my little one doesn t take soothie pacifiers but i actually tore it out and sewed it my adapter for mams pacifier and she loves it it s the perfect size not to big not to small also gave me a shipping day of feb 9th and got here on the 6th super nice 
5 5 same pacifiers we were given in the hospital baby loves them 
5 5 no more dropped or lost pacifiers i bought three of them 
5 5 keeps pacidiers handy fits 2 soothie pacidiers i ve had this for several months now and the velcro is still strong unlike some other reviews 
5 5 my baby girl loves these 
5 5 handy and a must will purchase again no sticky residue and baby doesn t mind taste 
5 5 absolutely love this little wub it has texture on the paws and it is just precious 
5 5 good
4 3 did not glow only after holding it under the light did it glow and only for a few minutes still love the mams though 
5 5 one of my one and only te te s that is what my emma says
5 5 bought these wubs as shower gifts my grandson loved his and they are so much easier for babies to grasp 
5 1 i was extremely disappointed with this order these pacis are the only ones my newborn can keep in her mouth so i orders 3 pairs of them the nipples on these pacis are not like the actual mam brand nipples at all so my baby cannot use them so irritating 
5 5 best pacifier
5 2 these pacifiers are my least favorite in the mam line the silicone around the outside became discolored almost immediately even after having been cleaned and sterilized they remain dirty looking my kid chewed more on the 34 knob 34 on the front so much that the paint came off rather than the silicone teething edges 
5 5 my son loves these
5 5 love our lil tiger wubbanub these lil cuties are easy for baby to handle are machine washable and not easily lost big thanks to the kaiser nicu nurse that gave us our first one we totally love them so much so that we now have 5 of them actually d:D
5 5 good product 
5 5 we received a tt pacifier in a bottle set that someone bought us we tried the pacifier and baby enjoyed it enough that we invested in more for daycare 
5 5 mainly bought these because my daughter s husband and my son s wife are patriots fans they re nicely made and just a typical pacifier if you re a fan and want a novel item for the baby this is cute to have 
5 5 good
5 5 the best pacifier holder 
5 3 love that they are see through and don t have a handle my son wants to pull on but you can t really clip it to anything and the actual mouth piece is huge my son was really thrown off by how much of the binki was touching his face
5 5 exelent 
5 4 great idea for a way to get an infant to take medicine i don t know how it actually works though as i gave them out to nieces and nephews at christmas 
5 3 lovely pacifiers but my 10 month old didn t like them so for now they are in the toy box
1 1 got two blue pacifiers understood that colors may vary not thrilled with style that i ve recieved 
4 5 great for carrying pacifiers in though i wish it were a bit bigger to carry a few 
5 5 perfect 
5 5 if you need a laugh you need to purchase this for some little baby we bought this as a joke for our great granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it in her mouth we laughed and laughed our baby surely liked this binky because she used it a lot it was very entertaining to watch the reactions of people when they first saw her with it in her mouth it is well worth the money just for the laughs i loved it 
1 1 i ordered these and chose the dots style and i did see that colors may vary but why give the option to choose i recieved two blue pacifiers when i was hoping for something more feminine 
5 5 i don t know what we would do without our wubbanub great product 
5 5 the stuffie is wonderfully made and my sweet girl looks adorable with it and genuinely seems to like it i recommend it and am ordering a second these rock very happy momma :)
5 4 baby do not love to eat
5 4 baby doesn t like eating
5 5 the pacifier good looking
4 4 very cute pacifier just harder to keep in the baby s mouth is the only complaint 
5 4 my newborn s best friend i tried giving her another pacifier that had a slant nipple but she didn t like it at all she likes this style nipple way better it s great having the stuffed animal on the pacifier because i can always see where it is i didn t realize you couldn t separate the two i normally like to sterilize bottles nipples pacifiers at least once a week so i have to improvise with this but other than that it s great to have 
5 5 came just as advertised with these pacifiers i have had times where i get different images on the mam pacifiers than have been shown on the product page images but this one was accurate we love mam pacifiers they are all we buy for our babies 
5 5 very well made and perfect for car rides i can give it to my baby and not worry about him losing it 
1 1 too long for even a 2 month old he s choking on it :(
5 5 too cute 
5 5 mam is our favorite brand for pacifiers and bottles something about the high quality material and shape of nipples makes them great the glow in the dark aspect of these are the best i m nearly blind without contacts so searching for a paci in the dark while being blind is a bad combo i can see these bad boys glowing from a few feet away making them easy to grab and pop back in baby s mouth 
5 5 love this product
5 5 love these paci s they really work hold them in front of a light for a few seconds before putting them in the crib an they stay lit for most of the night my daughter is able to find them in the middle of the night instead of crying for me to get it for her 
5 5 cheapest price on the net your child will sleep through the night guaranteed love these 
5 4 i have a couple other animal wubbanub binks but this one is my least favorite because the pacifier sits on the trunk that is curved to one side it makes the weight distribute unevenly this one is harder to stay put in baby s mouth i think once baby is older it won t matter as much though 
5 5 too cute 
5 5 love the wubbs
5 5 love
5 5 you simply cannot see a kid with any of these and not laugh cannot be done got these for the granddaughter and getting a picture simply cannot go unshared 
5 5 wonderful baby gift 
5 1 none available 
5 5 my son loves it
5 5 my bady loved her passy its very funny and well made
5 4 very good for new born
5 5 we have had three kids who all loved soothie binkies more than any other i love that they are one piece and all silicone so it is easy to boil them to disinfect 
5 5 these were the only pacifiers my daughter would use they are great 
5 4 i really love these pacifiers but at my local store a pack of 2 is less than 2 50 so i won t be buying them in bulk here even though i was hoping to find a deal still great pacifiers
5 5 love 
5 5 very good
5 5 this is the fifth pacifier we tried for my breastfed baby boy he took the soothie initially but stopped that pretty soon we tried nuk tommee tippee and the munchkin latch and he hated them all my mother kept recommending this paci it s the one she used for me as a baby i wished i had listened to her sooner he took to this immediately it s very easy for him to keep in his mouth even with jostling him around while picking up and putting down 
5 5 came exactly as described with a nice clasp that closes well 
5 5 very very good
1 1 i ordered a package of 4 pacis and received 2 not pleased 
5 5 description of product is just what i was looking for 
5 5 these were very cute and well made my son still never took a paci he just looked up at me like 34 where s the milk mom 34 overall though as a product these are adorable and well made though 
5 5 grandson loved it great quality
5 5 my order of the amber teething necklace was shipped quickly it was packaged in a beautiful bag and the necklace is high quality i would definitely recommend this seller and product to anyone 
5 5 it s cute durable and a great space saver 
5 5 after an extensive amount of time most would consider it overkill researching lightweight strollers i decided on this one we needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features like most umbrella strollers our usual stroller is a britax b ready so this is a huge difference pros assembly was easy all wheels come unattached as well as the umbrella the recline option is easy to work no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height 5 8 34 i suspect others that will use it that are much taller will be comfortable as well the cup holder there is a storage sack built in cup holder affixed to the toplarge umbrella with matching dot trim covers significant areastorage basket seems large enough to hold a diaper bag and coatno cons as of yet i second that this is the same as the ignite stroller by the first years i gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead but the brand is really a moot point for this to me the product registration form even references that this is an ignite model price point was about 15 less to go with this model vs the ignite lastly the colors are much more muted than pictured i was concerned that the stroller looked girly but honestly the colors are gender neutral highly recommend ;)
5 5 just received mine in the mail and i am in love this stroller is super sturdy glides across the floor and seems to be super cushioned for baby i love how large the basket is and there is tons of storage i am totally totally in love i just can t wait to use it when the baby comes everything i expected and more thanks recaro 
5 1 it was very warm to wear this on a hot summer day and its summer every day in singapore totally not feasible in our climate and does not work in air conditioned malls as well baby hates it 
5 5 we baught this after useing pockets for a long time and wanted a all in one for our daughter i love how easy they are to put on and take off the only thing i didnt like that as with any all in one it takes forever to dry unless you dry them in a dryer which i dont also these diapers will fit both small and chubby babys but im not sure if id call them one size as my daughters one 21lb and still fits this with it snaped all the way in and down
4 4 super cute my daughter loves it a few edges were not smooth hence the 4 and not 5 stars but very cute box to stash 34 secret 34 things in 
1 3 grand baby did not like them 
5 5 item exactly as described easy to use fast delivery
5 5 got this for our grandson when he gets bigger it will be great 
5 5 the screen is nice and large the image is much clearer than others i ve had and the range of motion for the camera is great i m not sure you can beat it for the price my sister has a different brand a very common one that is around 100 and it can t compare to the quality and functionality of this one i m so happy we got this 
5 5 i love this paci well actually it s my baby who loves it and he only take this paci the only con is that it s hard to sterilize other then that it s good product 
4 4 this is a good looking and sturdy bed i m forced to ding a star as the assembly is a pain since the parts are not labeled at all so you have to use your imagination and rework to assemble one more thing the bed i received although was unopened and new was manufactured in feb 2013 2 years before i bought in feb 2015
5 5 love this pillow it is perfect and makes sleeping so comfy i read reviews that said the pillow wouldn t stay together i have not had that problem at all 
5 1 had to replace the nipple as soon as i got it the one it comes with doesn t keep suction through the tube to keep the milk flowing also regardless what i did after a few seconds the milk would stop flowing and my daughter was never able to get it started mt herself so i was always messing with it so it was just easier to hold the bottle for her 
5 5 love this was great for airport 
3 3 very cute but it was difficult to fit to pacifiers in it 
5 5 bought as a gift an the mom was happy 
5 5 this was the best purchase my husband and i live in a hot humid mosquito driven area and this product works great we are also marathon runners and needed a cover that didn t flap around when we take my sons car seat in the jogging stroller it also protects when the sun is at different angles we have a graco snug ride 35 car seat and this fits perfectly my only wish is that it came in more styles and colors 
5 5 great screen protectors arrived when promised 
1 1 buckle is horrible ours somehow went missing and when i called to voice my concern i was basically told that couldn t happen yet somehow our buckle the replacement from the recall went missing from the time my son was dropped off at day care till the time he was picked up they are sending a new buckle but i don t feel cpmfortable using a car seat that the buckle can come off i assume while my husband was pulling him out 
5 3 i bought this to keep my little 2 year old in his bed at night and it definitely works he can see out through the netting which is a plus however he could unzip the zippers since they re on the inside of the tent too so i just use a bread zip tie to hold the zippers together and wa laa he can t get out at night yah the quality of the tent is a little flimsy the zipper broke after 3 weeks on one side but i was able to fix it this product has made it possible for me to sleep through the night again without worrying what he is getting into in the house it keeps him in his crib safely 
5 5 the feeder is just the right size for the baby mouth easy for him to hold the silicone food pouch maintains it s shape even when not full and does not flop around like mesh feeders do the holes are just big enough for tiny food pieces to go through without the danger of choking it s perfect for meet fruit and veggies my son likes to drop everything on the floor so the clip or very handy 
5 5 coordinates perfectly 
5 5 we love graco car seats keeps my almost 3 year old snug and safe has been washed a couple of times and still looks brand new 
5 5 keeps baby warm and safe fit is large 
5 5 have 2 under 2 and this allows me to keep an eye on both of them so thankful for this monitor has great range too we can grill on the patio in the back at night or during the weekend when the girls are napping and can see them in crystal clear definition 
4 4 after doing a lot of research we chose this car seat for my son it has the best overall protection so we really felt like my son was protected although thankfully we never had to test that out i will say that it is hard to clean though and after a few cases of the stomach flu we couldn t really get the smell out anymore and bought a new one this seems to be a common problem with most car seats though 
5 5 great price and love this dresser very sturdy and quick shipping 
5 5 awesome product 
4 4 my 18 months looks forward for his baths its very nice pros very good for toddlers cons it sticks better on the bathtub instead of wall tile from the bathtub but although its very good 
3 4 received rolled but it did stick to mh wall
5 4 ecoable is one of the better all in ones i wouldn t recommend the type with the sewn in insert because they take forever 3 dryer cycles 1 5 hours to dry i like the ones with the inserts that snap in because of the color of the insert and diaper lining stains don t show as much the size is generous the rise crotch to belly button is more than most other brands and the legs are gusseted preventing most leaks still of all the brands i ve tried i just found green mountain diapers workhorse cloth eez and will be staying with them they are a cotton cloth diaper tapered and with snaps so no snappies claws to use they must have a diaper cover to go over them but they are the next best thing to a diaper service in absorbency 
5 5 this is a lot easier for my son to learn than a sipping cup it took him 30 seconds to learn how to use a straw which is totally amazing for me the straw inside can be detached easily for cleaning there is not many hard to reach places where i cannot clean in case of mold growth my son has been chewing on the straw but there is no teeth marks 
5 5 i got the green it really is cut and i love it no patterns cartoon characters i almost got the black and i m so glad didn t chair is easy to fold unfold although it is quite bulky wipes clean the tray is not adjustable as others have mentioned but that s not really a big deal for me babies are messy so no matter how the tray fits they re still going to drop stuff my baby is 8 5 months old about 16lbs so she s pretty small so i don t need to swing the tray open to put her in yet there s plenty of room to climb out stand so be sure to strap em in 
5 5 great fabric that really keeps the drool in they look so adorable on 
5 5 works well 
5 5 this is a great crib for the price there are 3 height adjustments but you do have to remove the mattress mattress not included and take out the bolts with nuts on each corner to be able to change the height we just set ours to the lowest adjustment for a 1 year old which has worked out just fine the crib is very sturdy and feels very safe for the baby 
5 5 these are perfect for sandwiches i purchased these at a discount to review them but they are worth full price it s making the switch from plastic more fun they wash out very well i haven t tried machine washing them yet because it s just very easy to wash them out by hand unlike some other brands that i ve tried that don t flip inside out very well the photo shows this size vs the mini vs a penny 
5 4 exactly what i expected we wanted to try white noise for the baby and it has a bonus of other sounds as well the timer is a great feature although we leave it on all night 
5 5 we have had this for almost seven years and even though we no longer need it for what it is it is still awesome my husband has actually just recently made it into a bookshelf on wheels 
4 3 really cute and a steal for the price but the fit is a bit odd they are a weird width but still work fine my daughter be looking fly because there s a butterfly on the bottom p:P
4 2 this item does not say that colors may vary i received two pink pacifiers for my son they work the same but still 
3 3 these were smaller than expected and the sticky on the back wasn t as strong as i would have liked i noticed i had more leak problems with these than i did with lanisoh i have breastfeed for 12 months and had a decent milk supply if you do as well i wouldn t recommend these there are better cheaper nursing pads out there 
5 5 love them 
5 5 very good 
5 5 daughter loves this since mommy uses one too she carries her baby dolls and stuff animals :)
5 5 holds 2 pacifiers perfectly 
4 5 different color but works great 
5 5 works great for grandkids room 
5 5 these are great for on the go healthy snacks i was buying the brand name fruit pouches but realized how much money if save making them myself i m happy i found these little green pouches my son loves the homemade apple sauce i make him 
5 5 i got these at a discount to try them and review them i would pay full price though i went back and got more because i love them so much they make the switch from plastic fun they hold up to the freezer well also as i use them for frozen grapes the photo i took shows the small bags vs the larger version next to a penny 
5 4 that gift was a winner the baby loves it
5 5 i ordered the toddler pillow for my 4 year old daughter for christmas based on the positive reviews on amazon com my daughter was thrilled at the idea of having a pillow but said that it was too puffy soon after we received the pillow i got a very nice email from chris at little sleepy head pillows asking how my daughter liked the pillow when i told chris my daughter s feedback he graciously offered to send a custom 34 less fill 34 pillow the new pillow arrived within days the 34 less fill 34 pillow works great for my daughter she says it is comfortable and loves it i really liked the great customer service from a small family run company 
5 5 great reception great battery charge too can go all night without being plugged in so i can wear it on my bely withe clip on 
3 3 while the print is adorable and on trend i feel like the quality of this crib sheet is in par with ones i ve purchased at target for 10 for a 30 crib sheet i was expecting it to feel more soft than what it actually is the black print has already started to show some wash wear fading after two washes with dreft on gentle cycle low heat dry i definitely feel like you re paying for the print and not quality a bit of a disappointment 
5 5 stays secure for my toddler grandkids i also like that it hangs up on the side of the toilet 
5 5 super cute soft and functional
5 1 these are the worst bibs on the market the pocket doesn t catch anything and the fabric just soaks through i would only recommend buying the perfect pocket bib from a company called goo goo baby best bib in the world and the pocket really works not like these ones they are biodegradable too jen mother of 4 
5 5 my daughter loved this pillow very soft and cuddly 
5 5 nice
5 5 easy out of the box installation i found it easy to figure out how to move panels as well as connect two sets we are using this to cordon off half of the patio to separate a play area for an infant from the pool very nice looking and solid build absolutely a great product thanks 
5 5 my wife and i received this product for review with our beautiful 5 month old daughter i was so excited when it arrived that i wanted to call in sick the next day at work so i could just make bottles this thing lives up to its name genius finally we got to cut out the formula making bottle prepping hassle that we had to deal with every night my only recommendation would be to add a feature that mixes the formula and water together my daughter suffers severe reflux and very gassy so when we shake the bottle after it s made we end up having to skim the bubbles off the top to prevent her gas overall awesome product 
5 5 bueno
5 5 buen producto
5 3 good
1 1 grated product defective
5 5 the best thing i have bought for my baby i have used this masher bowl every single day since my turned 6 months absolutely love it 
5 5 love this chair easy to assemble convenient tons of compliment from non parents about how cool the chair is when we are at a restaurant 
4 4 very soft but the picture is totally misleading the giraffe is an ugly brown color not orange like in the picture same goes for the tiger all the animals except for the elephant are the same taupe brown color wish i had known before purchasing 
5 3 nice simple night light about what you would expect for the money 
5 5 ridiculously adorable 
5 5 i bought these for a lillebaby complete carrier i do wish they had a snap to keep them on because they have a tendency to fall off unless i remember to buckle the bottom when not in use but i m giving it a five because they work great to put my long legged two year old into a proper 34 w 34 position i feel less strain when she s in this position as well i feel that at 13 the annoyance of them slipping off is definately worth it the other option is a 200 toddler carrier 
5 5 my daughter absolutely loves these it s great to have multiples on hand so one can be chilling while she chews on another 
4 4 seems to work pretty well 
5 5 love this so cute and girly 
5 4 i got this as part of a promotion i have to say they are a good size i expected something the size of the pre packed ones you see at the grocery stores cleaning is not easy but not hard i love being in control of what goes into my babie s body 
5 5 transitioned to this from sippy cup when son was 10 5 months old he was able to drink from it immediately and learn that he didn t have to turn it upside down to drink the only time it leaks is when it s assembled incorrectly handles are great glass insert is awesome he loves it and i m happy that we re out of sippy cups and moving forward he drinks water and oj with pulp no problem in it now i m going to buy another one to start putting his whole milk in at 1 year it gets a little foggy between the glass and plastic but as long as i m wash it regularly i see it as just a cosmetic issue that is unavoidable but doesn t deter me from buying a second cup 
5 5 quality material matches the leather in my new ford explorer beautifully and i am no longer standing on my head on the floor of my vehicle to retrieve the items that i used to lose beside the seat loved this product so much i bought a set for each of my kid s cars you don t even notice they are there until something drops and then you are thankful 
4 2 runs very small son is 3lbs 4 34 smaller than the fits size for sm med and it s still too small 
5 5 very happy with my purchase i love
5 5 my son loves these he has trouble keeping a normal pacifier in his mouth this gives his little hands something to hold onto and he is able to happily suck on his wubba even when he isn t awake he holds onto it the wubba was also required for his one month photo shoot 
5 5 worth the money if your baby uses these pacifiers without the wubbanub my baby would spit her paci out and i would have to chase it down wash it off every few minutes 
5 5 when my neighbor showed up with a pink pacifier i knew i couldn t be outdone with my lil girl i immediately signed on to amazon furiously searched for a pink pacifier this thing didn t fail me all it s so pink suckable my baby is hip 
5 5 adorable but my dog ate it before i could gift it to my nephew 
5 5 perfect my son loves his wubbanubs we have bought the cow and dinosaur too they last and are easy to clean will definitely be ordering another soon 
5 5 my baby love these
5 5 i brought it for my sisters baby shower and it was so much fun
5 4 absolutely love love love wubbanubs such a cute idea and very nice for the baby it keeps the paci in their mouth and gives them something to hold on to my son always has to have one with him i have bought 3 so far a blue dog giraffe and a dinosaur they do get dirty so wash it often the only reason i gave this one 4 stars is because my son eventually ripped the paci off i dont think it was the product itself i think the reason is because my son teeth are coming in and he thinks its funny to jerk it out of his mouth but overall wonderful product and i would recommand any of the wubbanubs to people 
5 5 my baby wasn t a fan of this particular paci but they were good quality and exactly as pictured 
5 5 baby s favorite :)
5 5 excellent product
5 5 soothies are the best pacifiers in my opinion because the nipple is just like that of a bottle or mother both my daughters have used these now for their first few months of adjusting great product 
5 4 this is too cute and perfect 
5 5 works great and pans all the way around as well as zooms in 
5 5 my 5 month old is very tall 98th percentile but still was too short for other jumpers this one is perfect with the 5 height settings the seat itself is large but if your baby likes to 34 stand 34 and has good trunk control the large seat will not be a problem he absolutely loves it and can turn himself around to each 34 station 34 definitely recommend 
5 5 my son loves it defenitely a favorite 
5 5 love this thing for times i don t want to lug around a diaper bag this is a lifesaver i fit a regular sized pampers wipes in there and then have enough room for about 3 4 size 3 diapers i also keep a few disposable changing pads in the clutch as well 
5 5 i love that there is not a removable spill proof tab 
1 1 the stuff animal fell off with in first week 
5 2 these bottles have an inner nipple which takes up a lot of valuable real estate in the dishwasher they also became discolored after awhile i was not impressed with these bottles at all and ended up switching to the tommee tippee bottles which i like much better 
5 3 these covers were purchased after having two of the econobum covers we like the comfort and ease of use of the econobum covers but these no matter how you snap them are far too tight i think that it s due to the double gusset but it leaves marks on the babies legs they are 4 month old twins weighing around 10 lbs they don t have overly chunky legs either don t like them much they also seem like they will be far too hot for warm months it s like a thick vinyl car seat cover the econobum are more breathable and comfortable 
4 4 we really love this cup so far it does leak some often it s not bad but occasionally i ll step away from my daughter and come back and somehow there s a puddle that sneaked out the other negative is that the straw discolors very easily within the first few uses but overall my daughter 10mo can easily drink from this straw not too wide can pick it up with the handles and loves to look at the 34 feathers 34 it s the only straw cup she ll drink from we ve tried 2 others so far 
1 2 the railing would not stay put on my child s bed i returned it and will look for a different model 
5 5 my grandson is 6 mos old and this is the best investment i have made so far keeps him warm without big bulky clothing and it is fog moisture proof and wind can t get through it the bottom opens for feet to stick out so i see at least a couple of years use 
5 5 excellent quality and fast shipping very pleased 
5 5 a 
5 5 shipping was super fast and my son is so fascinated by his mobile now the fast music isnt a problem im extremely happy 
5 5 love the safety features it s a bit big when it s rear facing so we had to place it in the middle of our back seat but it seems very comfortable and my son loves it 
5 2 the replacement is great but for the love of everything that s holy why do breast pumps in 2014 still require so many parts to keep track of can t we move to better ux for breast pumps already 
5 5 so good 
5 5 i got the mirror very fast the quality is very good but what i like the most is that it is easy to install it on the rear mirror it is big enough to see everything on the back of my truck and side roads i really recommend this product 
5 5 like these better the the bumkins they re the perfect size and they lay flat which is great when you have a squirmy 8 month old who won t 
5 4 just what i expected it to be and of good quality 
5 5 this product is super efficient firstly its small enough to fit in my fashionable work bag 2 the silicone cup makes it softer on the breasts 3 it s easily assembled disassembled 4 it s quiet 5 got the bottle with the little graphics on it 6 because the first pull can feel a little strong i just gently squeeze the lever until my breasts are accustomed and gradually increase pull 7 works on pure suction so i can temper the force of the pull 8 did i say little and cute i really appreciate the thought put into its design i ve heard and still hear horror stories about the manual pump but i have not experienced it thanks nuk 
5 5 supper quick shipping great pump 
4 5 i got this baby food storage item to freeze liquid leftovers such as pasta sauce or my chili con carne that i make by the pounds on weekends i hesitated to spend almost twenty bucks on something that ziplock bags could do but eventually figured that a reusable container would be cheaper in the long run and more convenient immediately i can confirm that the almost too good to be true product description is accurate the silicone cleans ridiculously easily with just soap water it doesn t warp in the dishwasher doesn t smell at all and it remains amazingly supple when frozen to 22c 8f that s what my freezer can do spec says 40c 40f getting the frozen food out was initially a bit of a struggle but one vendor s tip was golden if i let it sit for one minute at room temperature the still rock hard pieces push out easily the one thing that took a little getting used to was securing the lid basically it s a floppy rubber piece with eight latches that are a bit hard to put on and if you nudge anything while putting it into the freezer it ll come undone easily but that s just the price of having a freeze proof sealing container so i won t ding my rating for that 
5 3 really thin blanket i was expecting a thicker more plush quality blanket found a better option at fred meyer 
3 2 they came dented and dirty and if you screw the lid on tightly no liquid will come out i was also hoping for a stainless steal interior with the cap but it is also plastic 
1 2 by the time i received them two months later my baby was not even crawling anymore he was walking 
5 5 excellent product thick durable comfortable educational wish they made a larger 10 ft x 10 ft one 
4 4 work well but too sensitive 
5 3 sheets and blanket are very thin but decided to keep it cause it is such a cute design and inexpensive my daughter loves it 
5 5 love this mointor it gave me total peace of mind becaue my little one slept best on her belly if i didn t have this i think i would have been a lot more sleep deprived because i would have been afraid to put her on her stomach this is the second one i purchased because the first one stopped working when my sister tried to use it but i will happily purchase a new one for each baby i bought this one for her becuase i think it is such a great monitor for the moms that worry plus her daughter was 5 weeks early and had some lung issues so this has given her some peace of mind as well she is also a belly sleeper and my sister just attaches it to the side of her diaper or to the back 
3 3 the package was damaged and the toy was a dirty and dusty somehow but the functionality of the item was fine 
5 5 my newborn loved these no leaking the are soft and easy for the baby to suck on
5 5 perfect compliment to go with pillow extremely soft and comfortable my wife loved it and was able to sleep so much better while pregnant
5 5 it works great for the price the materials are fantastic i have an easy time adjusting the belts and operating the buckles i know there were a couple reviews that said they were challenging but honestly the hooks work better than the other three carseats we have gone for the buckles are easy and i can even adjust the belts easily with my bad wrists a on this also delivery was prompt early even 
5 5 very happy i have both blue and pink
5 1 beware of length states 90 inches across my fireplace is 86 inches across and it was still several inches short i noticed this complaint on other reviews as well can t return it because i used it 
5 5 i used the wrap up until my son learned how to get himself out of it but it worked its charm in making him sleep when i needed both hands for something it worked great when travelling also and i didn t want to lug around his stroller this is one baby accessory you can use over and over again 
1 1 you get what you pay for
5 5 these are the absolute best for such a good price my kid loves to be swaddled 
1 1 i was very disappointed in the quality of this bag i purchased it because it s large and matches our carseat i carried it less than a month and the straps started to tear that s pretty sad when you pay so much for something 
5 5 enjoyed the mirror i am very satisfied with the scooterbugge
5 5 very cute 
5 4 tried once to my 8month old son failed to use this cup but then someday i wish he would love it 
5 5 my baby girl has been on and off sick with a cold for pretty much her entire short little life when she was diagnosed with rsv on top of all that snot i sent my husband on a hunt to find this thing because i tried everything else with no luck after trying two targets and a walgreens all were out of this little gem he landed at buy buy baby and finally brought it home it is a life saver i will say that it does take some magical powers to hold the baby down and suck all by yourself and my daughter absolutely hates it but it works great i usually hold my arm across her chest and arms to hold her down and then suck you will not believe all that comes out and she breathes so much better afterwards i like that i can take it apart and clean it versus that bulb thingie that gets filled up with mold ick i would say that the nosefrida is a must have for anyone with kiddos i ve used it on both my baby girl and my 7 year old and it truly is a gem 
5 5 compact i love the color and the idea of making them pike keychaine
5 5 my husband is the one who found this and i m very happy that he did we were looking for a brush to help loosen my son s cradle cap but everything in the stores was very stiff i wanted something soft like the one that was used on me if only i still had it this is the softest baby brush we could find and i love the wooden handle my baby is 6 mos old now with a good amount of hair and we still use it on him he seems to be happy with it too the only thing is it will straighten curly caucasian hair but i use cerave on his scalp to help with dry skin and that curls his hair without making it greasy i look forward to saving this brush and passing it on i m even considering buying 2 more for my 5yr old 7 yr old just so they can each have one i m optimistic that all 3 of my kids will have babies some day but it s okay if they don t 
5 5 ordered this to fit in delta mini crib http www amazon com gp product b002mzmdx8 ref cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26 perfect fit and firm without being rock solid even though this is 3 34 rather than the 2 34 recommended by the crib manufacturer the mattress is firm enough and fits snugly enough that i feel confident that it s safe comparable in firmness to my daughter s full size firm crib mattress 
5 5 works great 
5 5 life saver we attach this to the high chair when we are out the car seat and the stroller they keep toys from hitting the ground and needing to be cleaned 
5 5 if you have a snoogle you must buy this such a soft and comfortable difference i absolutely love it 
5 5 works very well for elimination communication our baby has been on the toilet since 6 months old and the seat is very well cushioned to support even the tiniest baby we also got a cheap one from ikea and this one is waaaaay better and it provides a lift to the knees which is a better body position for pooping :)
5 5 great for travelling and super light 
1 2 my 9 month old has a belly and these bibs do not work for her they are too stiff and don t allow her to be fully pushed into the table or highchair she kept trying to pull them off because they were uncomfortable 
1 1 very poor quality broke immediately after use 
1 1 these pull out in the diaper genie too easiliy wasting a lot of bag 
1 1 the idea behind this product is great i often struggle with my daughters squeezing pouches and making a huge mess so i was excited to find this unfortunately the closures are not very tight and they are able to open them and take the pouches out was actually going to see about returning them would definitely purchase in the future if the company figured out how to make them a bit more kid proof
5 5  :)
1 5 i ordered this the other day and so far so good the only thing i strongly dislike about this item is how hard it is to out together when you re alone worst 4 hours of my life 
5 5 we got this for our son for his first birthday he loves it it doesn t tip easily even with the rocker attached the fabric isn t quite what i thought it was going to be but it still looks and feels great everyone who sees this chair thinks it s so adorable and they re right it also shipped faster than we thought it would edited to add another photo he fell asleep in his chair one night it has come in so handy for when he was sick and didn t have energy to move around he sat in the chair and watched his cartoons with teddy a great purchase that i haven t had a single regret about 
5 5 excellent product 
5 4 nice
5 4 worked great for my grandson easy to inflate deflate 
5 5 works like a charm we don t have many accidents but there has been the occasional diaper that gets too wet at night a sippy cup of water spilled once and it never reached the mattress very pleased washes well but allow for extra time in the dryer as it soaks up a lot of water in the wash naturally 
5 5 these are nice tools for portion control in my ongoing quest to limit what i eat they are pretty too and the lids snap on and off easily 
5 5 for the price you can t beat it the balls get stuck sometime but my daughter 15 months has no trouble knocking them loose i like how you can lock it to store the balls with out them rolling out all over the place 
5 5 this made a huge difference in the phoenix weather we used to carry water bottles around just to try to cool off the metal part of the seat belts because they would literally burn our children s legs since using these the metal stays slightly warm instead of scalding hot highly recommend this product 
2 1 i searched everywhere for a car seat with a harness to accommodate my giant one year old he wears a 4t but is only one so i needed a harness that would last a few years until he is old enough for a lap belt this was one of the few i could find that didn t cost a fortune the reviews on walmart com were mostly positive but i should have listened to the reviews here after trying to tough it out and make it work for three weeks i am forced to return it the bottom button where the harness attaches is placed way to short on the seat i have smashed my poor son into it but after accidentally buckling a piece of his thigh because of the positioning which can not be adjusted i decided enough was enough when i try to help by loosening the straps it isnt safe because his torso isn t properly fitted removing the extra cushioning didn t help either 
5 5 finally baby is comfortable we always thought that our baby should be as comfortable as we are at night when we travel i wish i had known about this mattress topper sooner our 10 month old loves his play yard now and mum and dad are happy watching him sleep 
1 2 while i love the convenience of being able to directly pump into the bag these are not good quality bags they are overpriced and not worth the money they leak and waste precious milk several of them have torn while i was trying to open them prior to pumping which makes it hard to attach to the pump overall i would rather pump into a bottle and freeze in a higher quality bag
5 5 great for bm mom s or just for babies comfort 
4 4 i like the bottle i was a bit confused as to why the number are backwards on the outside but it made sense when i saw them on the inside i am able to measure the amount better by being able to see the numbers on the inside if you dislike plastic bottles like i do it s worth getting a bit pricey but overall a good bottle and very cute colors 
3 3 beautiful pacifiers but the water gets into them
5 5 i tried many different options before settling for dr brown s my baby took to the the bottles early on without any struggle unlike others medela playtex etc and i only wished i had tried dr brown s as our first option pros easy to feed no nipple collapsecons many moving parts bottles come with level 1 nipple
5 5 i absolutely love this crib it s beautiful sturdy and the perfect size for our room it was super easy for my hubby to put together me being 7 months pregnant i watched for moral support and praise my little bundle isn t here yet but it looks beautiful and seems like it will do a great job of keeping our sweet pea comfy i ve now ordered the dream on me dresser changing table and can t wait to see it when it gets here also in cherry the set should look amazing together :)
1 1 crappy product both the cups leak at the rim dont waste your money 
5 5 as most new parents we were faced with the fear and worry of 34 what if she stops breathing 34 our baby was born premature and so this fear was is very real as we have seen it happen in the nicu of course they have monitors to warn them when this is happening why shouldn t we have the same warning and peace of mind that we can prevent it also i searched and searched for an answer and stumbled upon safetosleep i debated for a long time whether or not to purchase this item as its no small price tag but then what price would i pay for the safety monitoring as offered in the hospital i read the reviews and jumped the gun this item says what it does and actually does it the alarm will go off for her slight movements but that can be fixed in the sensitivity settings it has warned us of a drop in her breathing a rise and when she gets picked up off the mat or rolls off later on all of these are very useful i love that i can talk to her using the monitor i love that it tells me the temp of the room because we can mimic the nicu temp i love the ease of setting it up and using it things i would improve are 1 different alarm sounds for different things 2 a backlight 3 longer battery life lithium 4 size options
5 5 very happy i have both blue and pink
5 4 ordered this puppy for disneyland and it kept my babies dry i felt like i was fully equipped for the rare storm in la it s a bit of a hassle putting it on and making sure it s secure but well worth it for the protection even made me feel better when people were coughing and sneezing all around and the little ones were really in their own bubble i own a baby trend double jogger and it fit great 
5 2 dont stick very good
5 5 only bottle my son will take 
5 5 one of the best things i registered for it s so very convenient compact and simple i love that i don t have to lug my whole diaper bag around when going to a restroom to change my lo or if we re just going somewhere for a bit and i don t need all the bells and whistles the one drawback is that the pad is a bit small compared to other similar products but otherwise i ve been very happy with it skip hop makes great quality products 
5 5 after reading the reviews on amazon us new parents decided to purchase the infant optics dxr 5 the setup was easy and the controls on the monitor are easy to understand and maneuver the monitor works as advertised we are able to see our boy even amid the darkness of his room and we have the peace of mind that we were unable to achieve with the sound monitor that is now stored somewhere in our closet i think this video monitor provides a ton of value and packs a lot of punch for the price it may not have the bells and whistles e g controlling the camera remotely zoom features etc but i d rather have something that works well with the core functionalities the camera has not failed us thus far and we suspect it will not in the coming future we definitely recommend this product 
5 5 it s amazing the quality even better than i expected it s roomy well thought out 
5 5 my daughter played with these when she was a baby all the time can be used for different purposes from toy to hanging things on her pram 
5 5 this is by far one of the most important things we ve bought since having a baby unfortunately once our baby s boogies get in the aspirator it turns into my dog s favorite chew toy i m on to my fourth nosefrida because the dog keeps eating them since our little man started day care he s been sick a ton and his nose is always stuffed this product is heaven sent they work so well its worth every penny 
5 5 purchased this for my son s pack and play the fabric is soft like an old tshirt exactly what i was looking for 
5 5 it is just the right amount of fluffy has what seems to be a waterproof layer 
5 5 really cute ithey re made of lightweight plastic only thing i would change is the fork spoon they re just too wide for little mouths the fork tines could be spread apart further to make it easier to stab the food keep it on the fork and the spoon just needs to be narrower the elmo handles are easy to hold onto and so darn cute 
5 5 a must if your baby is petite 
1 1 the first thing i noticed was the hanger was rusty this had flimsy material and top stches by hanger were already coming undone the style was dated and did not look modern at all i returned this one 
5 5 this was a gift sent to my daughter inlaw she loves it 
5 5 beautiful little frame 
1 1 it pills after only a couple washes disappointed in the quality 
5 5 this was pretty easy and quick to assemble my daughter loves bouncing in it 
5 5 love the car seat cover it looks great and fits on the car seat perfectly baby hasn t arrived yet but it looks like it will work well 
5 5 loving have extras at work 
5 3 i m using this with a wet bag for cotton prefolds i find it s a bit small and very cumbersome when it comes to changing out the bag i think it would work well for disposables particularly with the dekor bag system for cloth diapers you re better off going with a regular trash can 
5 3 after a couple of months of my son sleeping in one of those little rock and play sleepers the back of his head started to feel a little flat i ordered this and we used it when he was laying on the floor or on a hard surface it did immediately help his flat head so that was great my issue is more with the design the velcro is in a weird spot and not very functional also the outer ring of the head pillow thing is too small my kid has a big head and he was only able to use this for about 2 months before he outgrew it so i m not really sure it was worth spending the money on this thing 
5 2 seems like a great design due to being lightweight and compact but unfortunately i found it flimsy and hard to use the strap s ratchet would slip instead of making one last click that would have perhaps tightened it enough to prevent the flexing and wobbling that made me less than confident about putting my son in the seat and running through an airport with him in tow tried the unit on both our chicco nextfit and britax frontier 90 both seats were not stable enough returned the mini travelmate and ordered a more substantial setup from britax that worked on both our seats and was much easier to install remove because it leverages the seat s latch connectors 
5 5 great product well made easily portable and very versatile 
5 5 love the bigger shield pumping is difficult for me and this helps yield more due to less restriction 
5 2 i wanted to like this it was cute and flame retardant free i believe the tail frayed right away will wash ok as my babes spit up a lot its quite small should be a bit larger but man was this so expensive for something that doesnt really function the way i d like i cannot reccomend this even though i wanted badly to 
5 5 love it
5 5 my daughter loves it 
5 5 this is the cutest backpack my daughter loves it it also seems to be made really well which is needed as it carried by a young child 
5 5 best bibs wash great hold up to a lot of washing and still look brand new though i don t put mine in the dryer 
5 5 these are great great taste easy to administer 
5 4 like it
3 5 does the job perfectly the way i use it is as following i preheat the bottle to a bit warmer temp that i would give it to the baby but it in activated warmer and take it with us this way the bottle cools a bit but stays warm enough to comfortably eat i had never activated on its own or accidentally as i read in one of the reviews though my daughter had even pulled it out from the drawer and played with it a bit it won t warm a bottle from a cooler a warm state though you would need the heater with hot hot water or something that plugs in and those take up to 40 minutes to do the job so i totally prefer this one 
5 3 the pillow is all right but a bit small this pillow is 20 00 is too much to me i scale it should be on sale 10 00
5 5 easy way to portion out homemade baby food very happy with it 
5 5 beautiful
5 5 we absolutely love this crib can t beat it for the price my sons crib is nowhere near this nice and we paid more this is definitely the perfect crib :)
5 1 while i like the concept of table toppers this one is not one that i would recommend it sticks well on most surfaces but the print on the table topper is too bright and distracting our 1 year old sometimes can t spot little pieces of food lying right there in front of her i would have much preferred a simpler design preferably without cartoon characters and a lighter color 
5 5 excellent
5 5 i wish i could give this pillow company 10 stars honestly i have never been so blown away by the quality of product and outstanding customer service as i am with this company prior to ordering these pillows i had some questions for the manufacturer little sleepy head pillows whom i emailed much to my shock chris the owner actually emailed me back with everything i needed i then purchased two of these pillows for my twin 4 year old children they arrived very promptly and were clearly of good quality but unfortunately were too puffy for them causing their necks to be at a weird uncomfortable angle we were all so disappointed so i emailed chris as he had mentioned that they can custom make pillows and he told me no problem that he would make us two 34 1 2 fill 34 pillows within about a week they were made and shipped to us at no charge chris included a hand written note wishing us the best with the new pillows and to keep the old pillows with his compliments for when the children grow older or to use on trips are you kidding me who does that this company that s who i will recommend them to everyone and anyone who will listen by the way the 1 2 fill pillows are perfect in my opinion for my children anyway and my children absolutely love them do not hesitate to buy anything from this company as no matter what they will bend over backwards to help you thank you so much again chris kindest regardsnancy
5 5 arrived quickly and was what i was needing great product and will order from this supplier again 
5 3 it s made my sons break out a little but the necklace itself is great looking
5 4 good product
5 4 helpfull
5 4 this cup transfers liquid to my baby s mouth effectively without spilling 
1 2 i brought recently the philips avent 3 in 1 and at first was operating ok but i few days ago it does not work i always use this brand and never have this problem before i very disappointed 
5 5 i wish that holister would keep making the soco 
5 5 great
1 1 light bulbs burn out all the time not just fan doing it on another fan we ordered from this company 
5 5 amazing
1 4 not bad
5 4 it was a baby shower gift
5 5 very good 
5 5 amazingly cute bottles for great price my kid loves them 
5 5 great item
5 5 young mother loved getting this pacifier duo in girl colors as part of her gift
5 5 it s so cute we like it very much 
5 5 on a smooth service these work great 
5 5 it s good 
5 5 i may have been able to purchase a seat that was a bit cheaper but the convenience of the click tight and knowing britax s reputation for safety i feel that my baby is safe and comfortable and that means a lot you can feel that there is extra padding in the seat for that added comfort we love it 
5 2 battery life really sucks i do find a dedicated screen are much better than the growing tendency cameras that connect to your mobile phones tablets however it is a shame that the battery life of this device is so small we literally had to keep it plugged for the night because we are afraid it would not last the night and we would not hear our son cry definitely needs some improvements aside from that the screen size is the best night vision is also great and the ability to control the camera is also a great addition very wide angle of adjustments 
5 5 just picked them up and within 2 minutes they were installed in my truck truck is now protected form the rug rats great purchase
5 4 these super undies are not super absorbent like diapers but they are great for catching small accidents before the toddler can get to the bathroom i like to use them for long car rides i also like that my toddler can pull them up and down like real underpants good quality nice fabric however i feel they are a little expensive to use for everyday underwear and a little bulky under clothing 
4 4 i like the product but a bit plasticy but great for the price quick arrival 
4 3 update may 2015 i originally gave this product 4 stars and now i d give it 3 5 the company has made some improvements since i last bought a bottle but it still needs improvement my original complaint about no indicator on the dropper has been remedied yay for a company that listens to its customers however the dosage is still off the supplement nutrition facts says to give 0 5 ml and states that it s 34 half a glass dropper full 34 but it s not it s a quarter of the dropper full if you re following the indicator this makes me angry because now i realize i gave my infant 2x the recommended dosage everyday on the previous bottle i purchased since there was no indicator on that bottle i appreciate the company updating the product but with the dosage so unclear and 125 of daily recommendation rather than 100 i won t be buying this again after this bottle runs out i purchased these after looking at the ingredients for a prescription our pediatrician gave me it had dyes and tons of sugar why would i give that to my infant i don t understand our food industry in this country i looked up all natural vitamin d supplements on amazon and came across liddle ones it s straight forward and doesn t have any of the crap in it my only gripe is i wish it had an indicator on the dropper of how much to give your baby and that the amount was 100 of their daily allowance not 125 like the back currently reads i just give my baby less than half of the dropper and hope it s enough it d be nice to know exactly how much i m giving but i do like the glass bottle and it came very securely wrapped 
5 5 my baby loves these spoons and its short enough that he can pretend to feed himself without choking himself right away 
5 5 this is great for cold weather kept our little one cozy while walking the streets of nyc 
5 5 this bib is expensive but it s the best one we found comfy and absorbent 
5 5 cute unique print
5 5 the only nuk my daughter will take i love that it is all one piece so there are no mystery funk growing 
5 3 my oldest daughter loved her giraffe so for my 2nd daughter i wanted her to have a wuba nub as well i wanted something different from what was at our local buy buy baby i saw so many different options i opted for the kitten when it arrived the packagi ng was hirrible and i quest i n if this is a real wuba nub or a knock off besides the fact the kitten was significantly more expensive my daughter doesn t even like it 
5 3 my daughter is 100 breastfed we were having trouble getting her to keep a pacifier in her mouth and decided to try these she didn t like them they seem like a great pacifier but i can t recommend since she wouldn t take it it may works for others though 
4 4 my daughter loves this i would have giving a five star if it wasn t for the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the toy i wish it was a clip that i could change out the pacifier other then that it is wonderful my daughter loves holding it while sucking on her paci 
5 5 it s good 
5 5 loved it sadly my husband dropped it on the street and i refuse to ever use it again but i did reorder 
5 5 awesome product my baby loves it 
5 2 just got these in the mail i ordered these specifically because i loved the color and bird design but i received completely different binkies so they aren t the design i wanted but they do still glow in the dark 
5 2 great idea but my son never used it
5 2 way too big of a nipple it gags my baby great material and love the concept wish it was smaller hold it up to other brands and it s twice as big 
5 5 used these for cupcake toppers at a baby shower good quality so that mamma can actually use them later and not so expensive that you have to break the bank to buy 12 of them exactly what i needed 
1 1 my 7 month old son also fit the entire pacifier in his mouth yesterday and would have suffocated if i hadn t been there to get it out so scary i would urge you not to use this pacifier the fine print in the item description recognizes this danger and says to only let your child use this with adult supervision 
5 4 my baby loves them
5 5 we love it 
4 4 this paci had a small defect in the lamb s eye but overall great product 
5 5 we tried a few different brands and these were e only ones out baby would use it s trial and error bit this was our winner i like these because they are also easy to clean and there s not a ton of places for water to hide 
5 5 pretty and works great 
5 5 my baby loves these mams and even at 13 months old they are the only type and size she ll use we love that they glow in the dark and are so easy to find during night time 
5 2 i had the monkey worked perfectly and stood with baby giraffe s neck is too flimsy so it s harder for baby and mom to use 
5 5 my son loves this he wasn t holding a paci in his mouth well but these helped a ton 
5 5 love it
1 1 i believe the 5 star reviews are fake this is an awful product it s very hard to open and shut and the best i can do it sort of get it on and twisted a little bit which isn t totally locked and therefore i can t use the plastic cap for travel since it has to be fully locked for the lid to snap on properly the opening to the mesh is too small for a 2 inch piece of banana and the reviews that said it was easy to clean totally fake it s a nightmare to clean yes you can take the pieces apart but getting banana out of the mesh is most certainly not easy you have to hand pick each little bit out of the net i would send this back but i only paid a few dollars and it s not worth my hassle i can t compare this to other mesh feeders as this is my first surely they can t get worse 
5 5 it is a pacifier and it shows my team love it 
5 5 these are great pacifiers we tried several types brands before these and my daughter likes these the best by far advantages over others i really wanted to use the avent soothies but they just wouldn t stay in my daughters mouth they bumped her nose and in general just looked too large and slightly uncomfortable i also tried other nuk pacifiers what i liked about them was the shape the heart shaped shield seemed to fit better and just looked more comfortable the shape of the pacifier nipple was shorter and the shape seemed easier and more enjoyable for my daughter to keep in her mouth she loved it but it wasn t my favorite because it couldn t be sterilized and water would get trapped in the nipple it just didn t seem as hygienic as i would have liked then i found these the orthostar pacifiers are the best they are all one silicone piece similar to the avent pacifiers they can be sterilized and there is no way for water to get trapped anywhere they have the great shape that is more comfortable for my daughter s face and the nipple is just the right size and shape to make it easy for her to keep it in her mouth this is by far mommy and baby s favorite pacifier 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers my breastfed baby well take he simply loves them i wish i could find them locally 
5 5 my granddaughter loves these perfect for the middle of the nite when the pacifier comes out it is easy to find it is a soother also 
5 5 amazing buy it awesome the best pacifier in the business i love it and so do the children buy lots 
5 1 my husband ordered these for our two month old because he loves this brand of pacifier and we thought these would be an easy transition from breast to bottle they seem like great bottles the nipple quality is amazing it never collapses my one star is for the supposed anti colic feature you could loudly hear my son swallowing tons of air while eating and he would scream for hours after using one of these he also chokes and splutters during feedings we have three other bottle brands and he has no issue with any of those 
5 5 cute for the youngest bronco fan 
3 2 cute but i wish i would have known that you can t take it off the pacifier if i would have known that then i would not have bought this i think that s a very greedy move by the company to make these that way i won t be buying another im sorry i bought this one 
5 5 life saver thanks alot 
5 5 hilarious even better because it is bpa freegreat seller
5 5 baby loves these
5 5 these are amazing tried buying all the cute pacifiers and they spit out all of them except soothies 
5 5 hilarious kid only likes it a few minutes but it s hilarious
5 5 my daughter has had this for two montha she absolutely loves it we dont leave the house or go to daycare without it we even bought an extra for just in caseupdate my daughter is now almost 18 months old and we don t go anywhere without her 34 bug 34 as she calls him we have gone through two not because of her but our dog decided to give it a try also she loves him so much that before she pops him in her mouth for bed she gives his face a kiss best pacifier ever i will buy them for all my future kids and friends kids 
5 5 good 
5 5 keeping for unborn baby both of them seems nice 
1 1 i m shopping for a pacifier for my newborn sadly this one didn t work for her 
5 5 the design for these pacifiers is great very easy to clean most we ve had have a space where water gets trapped and starts looking gunky after a week or two so when we got these everything is open so i can wash them as often as i need without the water getting trapped anywhere 
1 1 sadly my baby didn t like this paci 
1 1 sadly my baby did not like this paci
5 5 my daughter only takes 34 soothies 34 and the dinosaur that i recycled from my son who never took pacifiers ended up finally breaking it took a beating so i found this and love it the elephant is really plush so it gives her a good nice sized doll to squeeze while shes sleeping and since she cuddles with it its nice not having to wake up to slide her passy back in her mouth every few hrs :(
5 5 everybody loved this 
5 5 these are the best pacifiers love love love a wubby :)
5 5 this is the only brand my daughter would take 
5 5 i can t find these in the store anymore my first child loved them only one she would take i am hoping they work for the one on the way
5 5 love this wubbanub got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb i mean if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal why do they need to be stuck together and then when our son still wasn t really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks and after one long evening of paci spitting and fussing i figured we might as well try the wubbanub our son loved it pretty much instantly and the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn t drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck head it rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger and while i fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling he loves that thing still it s lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile he s over 20 months now entering the territory of restricting it to the crib car and emotional moments but it s easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go with him on my hip and the paci in his mouth the giraffe is long enough that i can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing i m actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and i don t have the heart to take it away can t believe i m buying a wubbanub for my toddler but a lovey is a lovey for a reason and he sure does love this giraffe 
5 3 my daughter loved these pacifiers they worked amazingly until 7 months that s when she really started messing with them and playing with them her thumb kept getting stuck so i had to throw them all away and try to switch her over to a different kind ended up finding a pacifier by gerber that she was willing to use 
5 4 my daughter loved this so nice for her to be able to find it on her own at night 
5 4 fine
3 5 seems to be with all 4 of my babies they all preferred these until it was time to switch to the larger size at 6 months then they no longer wanted them i also like the design since it doesn t resemble a nipple or bottle which for me it is intended for soothing after fed and changed to get back to sleep after i set them down 
5 5 my son loves it it s easy for him to find at night 
5 5 it is a life savor 
5 4 love this 
5 5 i love these bottles for my 2 year old daughter the shatter proof bottle has taken quite a beating and the straws are well designed and great quality i ve purchased several of these and they quickly became our bottle of choice they re not totally leak proof especially if you leave the flip top open but if they do spill it s very little the only improvement i would recommend for this bottle is to make the strap removable it washes fine in the top rack of the dishwasher but the strap stays wet for quite a bit after you take them out of the dishwasher 
5 5 these are so soft they are so great for swaddling and cuddling they are perfect as burp rags staying cool in the summer blocking the sun as a blanky i highly recommend 
5 5 these are perfect for bottles needed away from home we don t have to carry a large formula container around and we also don t have to premix and worry about refrigerating or it going bad if not used in the day we mixed it s nice to just fill with formula and pop into a bottle filled with water and keep separate until ready for use 
5 5 daughter loves her wub 
5 5 great buy a good plain and soft bib is always necessary 
5 5 i love the weight and feel of this blanket the color is beautiful too 
5 5 i love this changing pad so much i used it for my kids then bought it for friends as well it keeps it s form well and is easy to clean 
4 3 cute no handle though 
5 5 this carseat has been great for my son he rode home from the hospital in this seat and at 18 months just exceded the height limit so he will be getting a new seat not only has this seat been safe and comfortable for my son it has also lasted him 1 1 2 years it is still in awesome shape and his new baby brother will use this seat when he is born in april this seat was a great buy and i highly recommend it 
5 5 love it
1 1 my package arrived with oil stains all over the box my belly oil leaked at least 1 3 of the bottle because they didn t care enough to close it correctly and it must have been old because when i bought another belly butter from target the texture was completely different 
4 3 i use this with a baby ergo i like that it fits on and i like the hood i wish it was wider towards the top to really go around the baby and cover the sides of the ergo really well it has snaps on the bottom that i don t understand what they are for could use improvements but i like the price compared to other carrier covers 
5 5 love the colors and size bought the month ones also several of my mommy friends have asked where i got them 
1 1 the child part of the baby monitor is no longer working and i only used it for a few days
4 4 we used this bag while my lo was an infant and it flew with us for 4 trips 8 flights ours is not ripped or torn at all but it is a bit dirty it did it s job though protected our car seat and kept it clean and dry would definitely buy again 
5 5 looks great perfect on the size thank you for the quick shipping 
5 3 i ordered this to use when we are not at home because my 17 month old doesn t sleep well in the play pen with the mat provided it fits wonderfully but i thought it might be a little softer i find he might as well sleep on a board wish it was a little softer 
5 5 easy to use fits car seat with base
5 5 nice quality for a stuffed llama i guess my kid loves it any ways 
5 5 my daughter and son both loved these 
5 5 loved
5 5 these are our favorite my son took the the infant size immediately after birth after trying several others so we ve stuck with them 
5 5 omg my baby boy love his pacifier every kid should have 1 
5 5 only pacifier my son would take 
5 3 love wannanub don t by the elephant as it doesn t stay as easily the angle feels wrong from staying in her mouth if buying for a child with hand eye coordination then it would be better
5 5 good 
5 5 we got the baseball binkis my son is 10 1 2 months old and loves these binkis the most 
5 5 the dragon is well made and nicely weighted so it helps hold the pacifier in place the legs wings and tail are chunky and solid enough that my infant can grab hold of them and pull the pacifier up to his mouth like all the wubbanubs we own the dragon has been really useful hard to lose easy to find in the dark easy for tiny fingers to hang on to and i can t imagine going back to using the soothies without a wubbanub 
5 5 great
5 5 we lover these binkys our son has used sever different ones but we found that other brands can get water in the nipple when washed and i always fear there will be bacteria that grows these are great and very cute our son is 11 months so we will be retiring these soon but we have another baby due in april and plan to start using mam from the start 
5 5 realy good
5 5 great product 
5 5 this pacifier was a life saver my daughter loves it and it s less likely to fall out of the crib 
5 5 the cutest thing ever the twins love it 
3 5 not sure why but my daughter would not use any other pacifier but this one 
5 5 shaped a little differently than most pacifiers as it doesn t contour to the baby s cheeks but that s perfect if you need to increase airflow and discourage teething rash 
5 5 breastfed baby loves it
5 5 the baby loves it just as it was described
5 5 fantastic
5 5 my little man loves this it s super cute and soft and everyone loves it 
5 5 my first two sons both liked soothie and gumdrop brand pacifiers my youngest son who is now 4 weeks chokes and gags on those brands because they are too big for his mouth he loves these pacis they are much smaller and easier for him to latch onto 
5 5 gave this as a gift and my friend s baby loves it 
5 5 great product bought as a gift for my nephew everyone got a kick out of them
5 5 my kid love these
5 5 we lover these binkys our son has used sever different ones but we found that other brands can get water in the nipple when washed and i always fear there will be bacteria that grows these are great and very cute our son is 11 months so we will be retiring these soon but we have another baby due in april and plan to start using mam from the start

5 4 good item 
5 4 good product
5 5 i really enjoyed and recommend 
5 4 the baby really liked this one
5 4 i ordered all of the novelty pacifiers that i could find for my grandson for christmas and i love them
5 5 will be getting more of these my little girl loves them we have tried other types of pacifiers with her and these are the best one for us and her love the variety of them also 
5 5  :)
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers
5 5 this is so cute i can t wait to see my new grandaugher with this i am so glad i purchased it 
5 3 easy to clean but my newborn has a hard time keeping it in his mouth 
5 5 he loves these and i bought this one as a backup incase we forget his regular one at home he is inlove with his red dog one though lol
3 3 ok
3 2 the pacifiers were fine but i ordered one s that showed boy colors i got pink purple i know it says colors may vary but at least get the gender right 
5 5 my granddaughter has never really liked a pacifier which is both good and bad the only one she would use at all is this one it s very durable and made it through the washing machine several times showing no signs of wear well worth the investment 
5 5 the only bink my 6 mo old will take 
2 2 my baby don t like it at all too hard
5 5 this is awesome invention 
5 5 the best for breast fed babies 
3 4 the packaging was terrible to give as a gift but the product itself is cute 
5 5 washes well perfect pacifier 
5 5  :)
5 5 these are wonderful every baby should get a wubbanub 
5 2 this was ok but the dark brown monkey is much better
5 5 my baby like it is shock and bite resistant not so much to say about a pacifier it s cool to buy a pair of translucent pacifiers because the baby cannot recognize de difference of color if you misplace or lose one of them some babies are picky =)
5 5 had so many people laughing its so cute to do a pic with
5 4 my daughter loves them 
5 5 perfection
5 5 our son loves this pacifier and is the only one he takes at night we had tried several other ones prior to this one and this is the only one he could keep in his mouth for more than a few minutes also he was able to put it back in his mouth quicker than with other ones due to the nice big handle on it 
5 4 gave it as a gift for my niece s new born it was a hit 
5 3 they are probably fine for many babies but mine didn t like this kind she preferred another one with a rounder shape 
5 5 these are the best and are darling i had them for my kids and i buy one for every baby shower i can t resist them a binkie and a stuffy what could be cuter 
5 5 best bobo s ever theyre not sold in stores anynore this was my son s favorite and is now my daughter s favorite as well 4 years later 
5 3 i m sure there are babies out there that love these mine isn t one of them i also find the clear part to be a little creepy when my baby does suck use it 
5 5 my son loves the soothie pacifier i am so glad i found these yellow pacifiers because there are literally 6 other kids at his daycare that have the green or blue soothie pacifier it is so hard for the teachers to keep the pacifiers straight with so many kids having the same one this yellow pacifier just solved the problem for me i am so happy i highly recommend this pacifier i have been told that breastfed babies prefer the shape of this pacifier my son was breastfed and he would not take the other shaped paci s so that could be true i m not sure all i know is that this pacifier is the only brand my son will use 
5 5 holds up to a toddler s wear and tear and can be washed and dried awesome 
5 5 these paci s are the best big kahuna loves them and he gets all the chicks with his new handlebar moustache 
5 5 love this great product
4 4 excited to use this wish the handle was a bit more sturdy but size and feel are very durable 
5 5 baby loves them i hate that i can t pick the design or even for a girl or boy 
5 5 lifesaver
5 5 my little boy love s his george that s what we call his wubbanub monkey great product helps with keeping the pacifier in and the most important thing not losing it 
2 3 colors that arrived were different than the appearance of what i thought i was purchasing they were blue and white instead of aqua and white work just the same but would have liked to have gotten what i thought i was ordering 
5 5 baby and mama love it the colors a for the baby to look at :)
5 5 very cute quick to receive
1 1 the 34 free air tunnel 34 reduces suction so badly that the baby is unable to keep the pacifier in his mouth the necessary vacuum is not created the worst pacifier we have ever tried 
3 3 i love this as it s easy to find my daughter s pacifier however only after a few days the nose of the giraffe started to come apart at the seam :(
5 5 cute 
5 5 perfect pacifiers our little man seems to enjoy them and it s easy to spot him and the paci in a dark room need to 34 power up 34 with a bright light before use not unlike many other glow in the dark products can t compare to other paci s as mam has been ours since he was a newborn
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers they are very cute 
5 5 my daughter loves it easy for her to manage and she loves the soft material 
5 5 just what i wanted
5 5 what a cute product these are great if your child uses a pacifier makes it easier to locates with an animal attached 
5 2 very firm for baby
5 5 excellent calendar to keep track of milestones
5 1 box was mutilated gate hinges were all broken and there were half the number of panels as described and as pictures 
5 5 cbis are the best especially for heavy setters must get 
5 5 love it
5 5 very cute fits well high quality 
5 5 i bought this toy for my 6 month old grandson for christmas he absolutely loves it he has the football and why not add the round oball what i like about this ball it s easy to handle he could grab it with his chubby little fingers i would definitely recommend this toy 
5 5 works as expected no problems 
5 5 love this saying and it s so true if only we believe just look at yourself and you ll see a living miracle 
5 5 fox pattern is very cute my daughter loved it 
1 3 doesn t look like it does in the picture on the box it comes out all floppy and thin not cushy compact as one would expect from a product that does what this is supposed to do i use it but really could have done without it for the most part should ve purchased something from the store so i could check out the quality 
5 5 i didn t research much about high chairs for kids as it gets exhausting every time we need something it means days spent online and in stores comparing different options this time decided to trust to peg perego s brand and wasn t disappointed the chair is very sturdy built the baby is secured in place even if the tray is off the fabric is easy to wipe i also love that it is easy to fold and it stands on it s own folded would recommend it to a friend 
1 2 do not buy i have had this for about months and have not been able to enjoy if for more than 2 days the 1st day we were so excited to use it and it worked great day 2 the camera would not connect so i called customer service and they did something over the phone where they reset it and it worked day 3 it worked fine day 4 lost connection basically we are over it and returning it asap i did not buy it from amazon but want to warn other parents not to buy this unit it has been nothing but a headache 
5 5 this rail is great nice and sturdy and once tightened and fastened it stays there had trouble with another brand coming unfastened when you lower the rail it is completely out of the way so you can change the sheets without removing the rail this is nice and long and fits clear to the mattress snugly with no gap this was actually purchased to keep a small dog from falling on the hardwood floor when she has seizures at night it works great and now we don t worry that she will break something having a fall this is really worth the extra cost 
5 5 great it is highly recommended 
4 1 honestly this is the worst i ve used so far i got this due to running out of bags and there was a sale in store i always wanted to try pump and save because it has the adapters so that i can pump directly without washing bottles but that along with the fact that the bags stand on itself are probably the only pros of it now onto the cons leaked on the first bag the zipper closure did not seal well the zipper was hard to open be very careful or the bag can break on my 3rd bag when it reads 5oz it was less than 5oz but when you fill 5oz and close it will spill over the edge of the bag is very sharp and hard so wear something thick to not scratch yourself besides the edges the other area of the bag feels flimsy and not durable wrinkle easily storing less than 5oz in a pumping bag isn t very feasible many moms build up enough supplies for freezer stash after a few months meaning babies drink more than 5oz easily hard to write on the labeling area i get why the bags are so low in ratings now if you still want the pros of medela bag i d suggest this direct pump other brands like honeysuckle sells pump bags or pump adapters separately or you can make your own by cutting a small hole for the adapters to fit in bags that are self standing get nuk only 1 leak out of 50 and for that one i did not zipped it properly or honeysuckle regular 3 leaks out of 100 honeysuckle pump bags feels weaker than regular but still only 3 leaks out of 100 or lansinoh 5 leaks out of 100 
5 3 blanket images are smudged my son still likes it so i kept it 
5 5 i love this little bag i use it to contain my reusable menstrual pads and diva cup when i m out and about it has a dry pouch the small one and a wet pouch the large one that work great for carrying both clean and used items it comes in so many cute prints too 
5 5 love this item as your typical apprehensive cautious and worrisome first time mom for my infant gives you the water temperature immediately and my five week old daughter enjoys looking at the light illuminating from the turtle which remains lit for the duration of the bath as long as it is submerged in water serving as a distraction if ever she gets fussy would highly recommend 
4 3 it s not my favorite wet bag it s a bit of an awkward size and it has no handle it s much too big to not have a handle it just wasn t really for me but i ll keep it to transport wet swimwear or something because it s a cute chevron print 
4 4 i am giving this a 4 star for two reasons 1 my toddler doesn t like to stand in a 34 cage 34 2 the construction isn t up to par in terms of steady wood i constructed it and put it next to the cooking island in the kitchen but had to keep looking to see my toddler was okay it just seemed too flimsy 
5 5 great pilot and great service
5 4 our 4 months old goes to anywhere with us because no one could help us to take care of him so it is very important to have something bringing his milk conveniently we tried couple stuffs before we have to bring 1 2 empty baby bottles one insulate bottle full of hot water milk storage bags or containers every time it is wonderful we have this now we got it yesterday and we start using it today now we only need to bring this one bottle filled with milk no more other baby bottles and containers or bags etc but one thing we are not quite satisfied is the plastic part of this bottle is a little poorly made it is not smooth enough i m worried my baby s hand maybe get cut in the future if he use it by himself 
5 5 we love this carrier baby sits in a more natural position and is easy to get in and out of even without help 
5 5 worked perfectly if you haven t tried these things and are using safety pins which i don t feel are really that safe give these a try the teeth on them are sharp but it s very easy to get the snappi on without accidentally pushing anything too far and poking a squirming baby you just stretch it over and release so easy 
5 3 this chair is fabulous if you don t have a ton of space for a standing high chair we loved it but my child is extremely messy when eating i got really grossed out every time i went to clean it i always found lots of hidden food under the seat flap it was always stained with some kind of food from hands touching the fabric we just moved to a booster seat because i couldn t find a 34 perfect 34 high chair if you don t mind cleaning and washing fabric all the time then this is a good option 
5 5 very nice very large good quality
3 3 maybe it s just me but i found that while this did a good job preventing cracking and dryness it did nothing to help with pain and rawness and almost made it feel worse 
5 5 pros machine washable easy to retrieve for you or baby easy for baby to maneuver themselves hospital recommended pacifier brand cute cons must use this type of paci cost sort of but worth it 
5 5 excellent product glad i made this purchase 
5 1 the proteins in baby s only are 82 casein same rate as in pure cow milk which makes it too hard to digest for infants under 12 months and causes severe constipation proteins in breast milk are 10 casein in early lactation 40 in mature milk and 50 in late lactation the rest is whey proteins in regular infant formulas are usually about 40 casein this is the reason why baby s only manufacturer nature s one markets it as a toddler formula which it is and an excellent one and not simply because they want to promote exclusive breastfeeding before 12 months like they suggest 
5 5 gift
5 5 love it 
5 5 this is the best nap mat on the market worth every penny 
5 5 awesome and the baby loved it
5 5 nice easy to put together my daughter loves her new car seat 
5 5  love
5 5 this fits perfectly over the mats at daycare it rolls up nice and neat the fleece blanket on the top is plenty warm throw the whole thing into the washer and dryer and you are good to go this is great product that i wish i would have found a long time ago 
5 5 i absolutely love this crib set it fit our nursery perfectly 
5 5 my 2 year old loves this pillow all though he takes the pillow case off every night it s still a perfect little pillow for my toddler ;)
5 5 perfect for wet sandy water shoes on vacation 
5 5 love it 
5 5 oh how i love this blooming bath it s soft enough for a first bath but completely sturdy i found it at target for 19 99 half off the original price of 40 this makes bath time easy and fun especially for newborns highly recommend this for any mom great for photos 
4 3 i wanted to like this cover due to the affordability unfortunately i ran into a few problems 1 size this can be a pro or a con the cover itself can fit inside of a bumgenius 4 0 for a better perspective in the size the smaller size allowed a comfy fit for my newborn but i do have concerns regarding the fit as she grows the size can make finding a correct sized insert a headache 2 bee bum the cover does not allow a nice trim against the body i placed one 5 layer insert and a small newborn insert as a booster and i suddenly ended up with a fluffy butt i have placed the same set up in my flip and ecobum similar in price range and the results still allowed a trim look 3 adjustable snaps there is no stitching that allows the adjustable snaps to lay back when i would undo the cover the side snaps would automatically curl slip forward into the mess on the insert if the fecal matter accidentally got on the adjustable snaps due to the curling issue of the flaps i would have to chunk the cover in the dry pail i may get 1 2 uses out of the cover due to this issue 4 quality of the stitching compared next to a lower range cost cover like ecobum this kawaii baby cover is lower in quality 5 front pocket it has a 1 4 pocket at the front that allows an insert to hold its place better which is a positive since covers similar in cost like ecobum do not have this feature 6 laminated polyester the waterproofing material is thicker than compared to a ecobum the issue of concern is the tpu for this cover has a slight stretch stretching can cause issues with waterproofing and can lead to cover leaks so far i have not had any leaks in relation to the cover tpu but i am concerned with this issue in the future as the cover becomes used over time overall pros nice snug fit for newborns and smaller sized infants has a 1 4 front pocket for holding inserts does as expected in acting as a waterproofed diaper cover i literally place this cover at the back of the stash and only use it on laundry days i am willing to give the company another try with their pocket diapers but this particular cover from kawaii baby is a personal no go for me 
4 3 we are happy with the mobile itself it was very easy to put together and was just what we needed for our little guy s room however we cannot give this item 5 stars because we feel like we were cheated we would call it overpriced since it came with a clearance sticker for much less than we paid we paid about 40 for this product on amazon when it arrived the box was pretty beaten up and there was a clearance sticker on it for 6 99 this was very disappointing 
5 5 great product arrived promptly
5 4 this carrier is great for what i need it is pretty basic and good for around the house i have twins and it can be hard to get things done around the house this is pretty easy and simple to use so i can wash dishes and make lunches while carrying around one of my sons this has been very helpful and soothing when one of them is fussy they seem to like being in it and enjoy feeling my movements as i walk around the house i wouldn t recommend it for wearing over long periods of time but it is comfortable to wear around for up to an hour or so more than that and your back may start to hurt so if you are looking for something basic this is a good choice and very affordable i have a more expensive carrier i recieved as a gift and i have only used once due to the fact that it is near impossible to get on and put the baby in by yourself this is easy to put on and adjust it is also easy to get the baby in and out of 
5 5 when i opened these i expected a strong plastic smell nope they smell like coconut the beach great colors shapes can hardly wait for my little one to be big enough to play with them 
4 3 3 stars because it looks awesome really fun to play with and looks great as a desk ornament but it comes with a european plug with a standard us wall plug adapter to attach to it the adapter keeps falling off and won t stay on plus it s a bit faulty seeing that i got zapped by it when i plugged it in choice is yours 
5 5 i love how light the car seat is it is very easy to pull in and out of the base as well i am very happy with this product 
5 5 great for my 22month old he loves the bottle the only bad thing is my son bites the nipple and i have to replace it 
4 4 this is a very clever design all the holes are under the soft plastic top when your child goes to drink the liquid seeps out the edge if you turn the cup on its side and press the top you can get liquid to come out but if just dropped there isn t much spillage top rack dishwasher safe hope this helps 
5 5 the little girl this went to loves it very colorful and made very well i think there will be years of enjoyment 
5 2 we thought we d use this all the time but honestly it s not worth the hassle of attaching it to the megaseat you have to buckle baby into the seat then attach the tray especially if you got the megaseat instead of the bumbo because your baby s a chubby bunny who can t just slide in but there s no catch or click or snap you sort of push the two parts into place and the bottom piece has to slide underneath the seat so you re trying to lift the seat up with the fussy baby in it while attempting to finagle two tray pieces into place it s not easy this tray is just not very well designed 
1 1 not working
5 3 son still leaked
5 5 awsome love it 
5 5 works great 
5 5 gave to new grand baby and parents use it a lot as they live in arizona 
5 5 nice
5 5 looks very sleek and works exactly like it looks and says 
5 2 they were way too little
5 3 our baby loves chewing on these they don t really work as a pacifier as he pops them out if just sucking on the nipple but as a teether they re great we couldn t find a good 100 silicone pacifier 
5 5 love the design and material 
3 3 love these pacifiers had one and needed a few more however the title and pictures show 2 pink pacifiers which is what i wanted and thought i ordered but a pink and green set is what i received buried in the description i see now that it says pink and green the title and pictures need to reflect this information otherwise you ll have disappointed customers like myself really wanted two pink 
5 5 what a great pair of pacifiers the colors are really great and it s of a nice quality this is a gift for a friend s baby shower 
5 5 my baby s favorite pacifiers the glow in the dark only works for a short time and is very dim so don t buy it expecting it to glow all night its also orthotic 
5 5 got this for my friend s little boy it is very funny and adorable great quality arrived early 
5 5 great product 
5 5 my twins love these prefer them to any other pacifier
5 5 my baby uses munchkin latch bottles and these are his favorite pacifiers i gave him many options but he chose to match bottle to paci also just and fyi i breastfeed and don t have problems switching back and forth i m not sure if that is kid dependant or has something to do with the brand 
5 4 funny little pacifier :)
5 5 love it
5 5 i bought the monkey and elephant for my 7 week old who could not seem to keep the pacifier in his mouth on his own before the wubbanub i d have to sit and hold the pacifier in for him the wubbanub helps keep the pacifier in his mouth when his head is turned to the side i can prop the wubbanub in between my son and the side of his swing or bassinet the monkey also lies flat on his chest and holds the pacifier in when he s looking straight up although my sons isn t quite old enough to grasp the monkey with his hands i can kind of wrap my sons arms around the monkey to help him keep it in place i found that the elephant is too floppy and doesn t work as well because the pacifier is attached to the elephant s trunk the pacifier with the elephant doesn t stay in his mouth as well as the one with the monkey 
1 2 good brand of but i guess the nipple is to flat in soft so my baby will not suck on them waste of my money
5 5 love that these breathe well for my toddler 
5 4 my son liked these best until he had a bottle then he wanted pacifiers that matched his bottle shape 
4 3 i wish the binky would detach so i could sanitize the binky
1 1 do not buy this the way it is designed is flawed we heard our child crying and thought she had dropped it on floor but she had turned it around and it got stuck in her mouth just the right size very dangerous 
5 3 hard to sanitize the pacifire without wetting the whole thing 
5 5 these pacifiers are the only ones i ll let my daughter use i love that they are completely natural so she is not sucking on dangerous chemicals and i also love that they are all one piece so there are no crevices for germs to hide in i also love the look of them my daughter is ebf so she doesn t take a pacifier much but these are great teethers also we have purchased several teethers but she prefers these over most of them 
5 5 my grand baby uses these bought them as part of a gift for someone else love em 
5 5 our son love this great pacifier shape for a newborn and he can easily take it out when he is done and you can t lose these easily 
5 2 i don t like that the nipple is completely sealed which means there is a bubble of air in it unlike other brands i ve tried it also seams to wear out fast by that i mean it starts to change colors at the base and i feel like i have to replace it sooner than other brands 
5 5 good choice my little one loves them 
5 5 great buy item arrived as expected 
5 4 great product gave as a gift but was exactly what i was expecting 
5 5 baby loves it
5 5 perfect baby prefers this kind over all others we ve tried 
5 5 good
5 5 i have two new grandsons and they love this adorable reindeer 
5 5 love them
3 1 its not gumdrop is another brand my newborn baby loves it but i am really disappointed
5 5 it was great i loved it 
5 5 excellent i bought this pacifier when she was born and she sucks nothing but the specified
5 5 great 
5 2 they glow for a very short time 
5 4 they arrived on time and are great the flavor doesn t last long but it was still worth the pay 
5 5 loved them theyre perfect for my baby girl:)
4 5 this is the only pacifier that my child can use all the others that i have tried caused a gag reflex response we tried not using a pacifier but babies need something to soothe them i had tried the dr brown s pacifier stage 1 for younger babies but my baby would just spit it out or it would come out it was like it wasn t long enough i figured i just try the ones for older babies stage 2 i am glad i was able to find these pacifiers because it is not fat or bulky it is thinner almost flat and elongated it doesn t cause my baby to gag at all i wish they would provide two covers one for each pacifier but they only provide one for both i still gave them five stars because these things work for my child no more sleepless nights or fussy baby yay 
5 4 our son uses it to chew on while teething and works well for him 
5 5 great product would it always recommend
5 5 excelente
5 5 really cute
5 5 lets just say we have 6 of these in rotation for our little girl she loves them 
5 5 works well sweet lamb 
5 5 great pacifier i don t use any other kind 
5 5 love the color 
2 1 didn t work for me considering return so cute but my baby wakes up from the noise when i turn it on on the lowest volume:(
5 5 good
5 5 my kids always loved these as babies if the pacifier always falls out of their mouth but they still want it you can kinda prop the stuffed animal part against them to help hold it in their mouth 
5 5 my daughter has lived these things since day one we don t leave home without them 
5 4 these are nice but compared to all of the other styles this one makes my son look like he is out of a horror movie with the see through detail they are my least favorite of all of the styles colors by avent 
5 5 as described and hilarious
5 5 our two boys loves these only problem with it is that our older boy steals the younger s passy since he can see it in the dark now :)
5 5 good
5 5 great sturdy big kid binkie 
5 5 great price 
5 5 love these
5 3 while these are cute they aren t as practical as i originally thought the pacifier and animal don t come apart so you can wash the whole thing in the machine but then you have to sanitize the pacifier by dipping it in boiling water but not getting the animal wet these are the kind of pacifiers hospitals use but our baby only likes the thumb shaped kind so she won t take these she also can t sleep with soft things until later so we could only give her these when she is awake or later when she is older i will probably cut off the pacis and use them as cute stuffed animals 
5 5 love love love these pacifiers so cute and the stuffed animal makes it easier for babies to hold these pacifiers they re also much easier to keep track of than the standard variety just throw them in the washing machine to clean wubbanubs are so popular in my house they ve become one of my go to baby shower gifts highly recommended 
5 4 i wish we had this when we got home from the hospital we spent the first few weeks propping up the pacifier with blankets but then keeping a close watch on the baby i think i would ve felt safer and not feel the need to constantly supervise with the wubbanub we got the product when our son was 2 5 months but he had really outgrown its usefulness because he wouldn t lie as still as when he was a newborn he would turn his head constantly and the wubbanub would fall out and he could never get it back i think this product would be fantastic for a baby 2 months and younger 
5 5 great product 
5 5 bought for granddaughter she really digs this and reaches for it all the time 
5 5 these are great very durable i figured the rubber mustache would be cheesy and break still holding on strong it is a hoot 
5 5 love it love it baby loves too 
5 5 nice
5 5 love love love these pacifiers so cute and the stuffed animal makes it easier for babies to hold these pacifiers they re also much easier to keep track of than the standard variety just throw them in the washing machine to clean wubbanubs are so popular in my house they ve become one of my go to baby shower gifts highly recommended 
5 4 we were given one of these at the hospital by the person who tested our baby s hearing and she took it relatively well i am exclusively breast feeding for now and we ve been given conflicting advice about pacifiers versus no pacifiers i m a first time mom and adjusting to breast feeding i don t care what anyone says it really isn t all that easy but she and i are getting there regardless the pacifier doesn t seem to be harming her latch or making things any more difficult it also does seem to calm her down at times it actually calmed her tonight when i couldn t get her to breast feed for whatever reason couldn t get her to feed until she was calm and i needed the pacifier to help her calm down so although i think you should do whatever works for you and your baby these seem to be worth a try if you are interested in trying pacifiers the ulubulu pacifier clips will work with this pacifier if you also are looking for clips 
5 5 just purchased this after reading reviews on a mom fb page this pacifier is great slides right into my baby s mouth and doesn t come out as often as the philips avent pacifier which i had been previously using since that pacifier has a little handle at first i didn t like that it didn t have a handle but that s one of the reasons why it doesn t fall out very cute prints too also it comes with a sanitizing box which you fill with a little bit of water and sanitize in the microwave genious i will be purchasing a couple more boxes to have extras lying around since we are always losing pacifiers 
4 3 my 5 week old son did not care for these but he seems to be pretty particular about his pacifiers 
5 4 as a nursing mom i resisted using pacifiers for probably two months however i wanted to have some pacifiers on hand in case we needed them for sleep the interesting thing though was that my daughter wouldn t take a pacifier so i put them away for a while around eight months we moved to a new house and i found my daughter was having trouble sleeping i pulled out these pacifiers and they soothed her as she dealt with new house new room she didn t use them long but i was glad to have them on hand 
5 5 good deal
5 5 so cute
5 5 1
5 5 excelent
5 5 we tried about six other different more expensive brands and yet these are the only pacifiers my 6 month old will take such a lifesaver in long car rides 
5 5 my kid loves it 
5 5 we tried this pacifier out after trying many different ones this is the only pacifier my little one will kind of take she doesn t like pacifiers and tends to gag with most of them but she will occasionally take these in the car when she s starting to get fussy the nipple on these seems smaller than others we ve tried so i m assuming that s the reason 
5 5 my baby started with wubba nub at birth she learned how to grasp the doll part early on she loves it it s a must have 
3 1 my baby didn t like these the nipple is so hard be uses it as a ball instead and throws it 
5 5 wubbanubs have been a blessing for us i can find his pacifier now no digging in a car seat or losing it in the car 
5 4 my daughter currently uses the 0 6 month size i just purchased these to have on hand when we need to size up i selected 34 girl 34 colors when i ordered but i received 2 white ones with blue 34 handles 34 and blue camo pattern but that doesn t bother me my daughter can rock boy colored nuks she doesn t care what color they are the description specifically says colors may vary so you are taking a chance to get different colors this listing was just the cheapest one which is why i chose this one if color is something that would bother you i d go with one where you are guaranteed to get what you want either they these are legit nuk brand and will be perfect when we need to size up :):)
5 5 my son is 18 months old and cannot live without his wubbies we have 4 of them and the frog is the lightest in weight he has been using a green soothie pacifier since being an infant and we introduced the wubby around 7 months when he was old enough to reach for his paci in the crib at night this little product helped him go back to sleep because he could soothe himself immediately once he retrieved his wubby we only let him have it in the crib because it is quite an addiction we let him have two one to suck and one to cuddle he switches them out intermittently not sure how to begin weening him from using it but for now we are deeply satisfied with this product 
5 5 the best baby shower gift i ever received i bought this as a replacement since we lost ours for a bit never hurts to have a backup this became our sons beloved toy and comfort pacifier at all times we have now weaned him off at a year and a half but we will definitely be purchasing another type of wubbabnub for our new baby 
5 5 it s best to buy in bulk i saved money and had backups for when pacifiers got thrown out of the stroller it s the only kind my granddaughter would take 
4 3 my son will only use the mam pacifiers i just wish he would stop biting through them at between 4 and 7 per pack it gets pricey the designs on these were pretty 
5 4 these are great as a pacifier they glow in the dark for only about two minutes so don t expect to wander into your child s bedroom at 4 in the morning and find the magical pacifier that they threw onto the floor under the crib 
5 5 love them makes finding a pacifier much easier now
5 5 daughter started on these and we can t buy enough they are chained and tethered to everything we own she won t take any other style and at this price i can afford double 
5 5 excellent product 
1 1 the logo faded within a month all colors within a week what a cheap product 
5 5 if baby loves it i love it amazon having them on sale bonus
5 5 if yoou know a baby this is a must
3 4 this seems like a high quality pacifier but it is by far the most enormous nipple i have ever laid eyes on it really is ridiculously big but maybe there are babies out there who would really go for it mine wasn t one of them my particular kiddo wouldn t touch it but in fairness i never did find a pacifier that he would take 
5 5 these are great and my son loves his easy for them to hold and to find i just throw them in the washing machine and they are clean :)
5 2 way smaller cheaper looking then i imagined i had in mind a tradintional beanie baby size weight quality it s a very small lightweight stuffed toy reminded me of something youd get out of a claw machine pacifier was fine though typical size and quality 
5 5 great buy
5 5 she loves them 
3 2 takes way too long give the temp also the nipple is too long so my son really didn t like using it even though he is a pacifier junky would be a great idea if they fixed my issues 
5 5 muy buenogracias 
5 5 expensive and baby hated it but was shipped fast and was exactly what i ordered 
5 5 just what i was looking for
5 4 we bought this pacifier because it was free of the toxins found in so many other pacifiers it is well made but i think my son has more trouble keeping this pacifier in this pacifier than he does others due to its design and probably being a little big for his 2 month old mouth 
5 5 we lost our sons first and only one of this wubbanub at disney and we were devastated found this one and ordered right away it shipped so fast and got to us even faster our son was so happy and so were we 
5 5 love it go lsu tigers 
5 5 these are amazing my baby loves only these 
5 5 super cute 
5 5 babies first love of a paci
5 5 good
3 3 the pacifiers are great but the problem is it s impossible to know what colors you re going to get if you don t care at all get them if not you can grab these in most grocery stores or pharmacies targets etc 
5 5 love this purchase it is so cute and you can t find this one in stores 
5 5 nice package and my friend is happy to receive it for her new born baby 
5 5 my little one loves this it s now our favorite 
5 5 best pacifiers ever these last so long and i love that they are natural i love the size of these as well just make sure to boil them when you get them for five minutes as directed i am a repeat customer for these 
5 5 so cute love this 
5 5 baby shower gift
5 5 my baby loves these 
1 2 mattress would have been fine but it was shipped in a box that was too small so it had to be folded over the mattress does not lie flat and the surface is bunched up and not smooth you can feel the ridges even with the mattress cover on we could not return it bec we needed it immediately we had shipped it ahead to a vacation home and we arrived at night so our baby had nowhere else to sleep but we would have returned it otherwise 
5 3 i love my ubbi and have never tried using any bags other than the ubbi bags with it my issue with these bags is that they tear very easily if i let the ubbi get more than 3 4 full the bag breaks when i take it out of the ubbi it seems to get caught on the side of the ubbi and tears as i pull it out of the can that is very frustrating and quite frankly pretty gross because i end up with dirty diapers spilling onto the floor yuck i will keep buying these bags however because the size is perfect for the ubbi 
5 4 i ordered on line and it was as shown in the picture good quality 
5 1 these tear up your doors don t buy them 
5 5 love it
5 5 love it great inside and outside
5 5 i bought this for a friend the baby loves it she uses this as a teething ring her favorite 
5 5 this is the best seat there is for extended rear facing best value so easy to use will last a really long time we love it 
5 5 the mini crib mattress is very good quality and fits the davinci mini crib perfectly very happy with purchase 
3 4 there aren t really instructions on how to put it up but it is numbered you do may need a magnifying glass to see the numbers on the picture though also some of the decals don t stick very well i have to keep pressing them down but i do have slightly textured walls so it may be because of the walls 
5 5 very cute 
5 5 love that i can keep things plugged in and babies safe 
5 5 super soft and just the right size for a toddler
5 5 this is great it adds more space for them to roll it works great on hardwood too because of padding 
5 5 this is a nice towel and a good size for my 15 month old granddaughter it washed up very well 
5 5 our toddler is all about cookie monster and elmo right now so when i saw this i had to get it for him he loves it the towel looks great and is plenty big enough for our 18mo its not a super heavy weight fabric but its not cheap hotel towel thin either 
2 1 i hate it seems like mattress for dolls not real baby size smaller than advertised and too thin
5 4 bought for my grand daughter very nice colors and quality 
5 5 recomendado
5 5 are you confused about what kind of car seat to buy just get a britax the safety is great the clicktight models have a nice recline even in forward facing i shopped around a lot trying to find a seat that was affordable and filled our needs it was a waste of time should have gotten the britax right away 
5 5 i m trying to teach my 15 month old how to self feed using utensils which means meal times are incredibly messy yes these bibs are large but they cover up everything even part of the high chair this saves her clothes from being completely ruined by apple sauce spaghetti sauce mushed carrots and anything else she can manage to make a huge mess out of plus they are easy to clean you can thoroughly rinse them off in the sink and hang dry them or wash in cold water on delicate cycle and hang them to dry if you are buying them to add to outfits for everyday use i wouldn t bother they are meant for keeping food off of your child while they master the art of self feeding i love them so much i m ordering more 
3 2 it s very cute and looks exactly like the pictures however it is not easy to hang up the wall art or diaper stacker because the ties aren t long enough and even more disappointing after i washed the blanket for the first time the stuffing inside of it got all bunched up now it is lumpy 
3 3 it s nice that it has the weighted ball but the cup tends to leak even if you use the little pressure knob thing 
5 5 just got mine today absolutely love everything about this black backpack i would recommend it to all my mom friends it also can be worn by daddy fits everything i need for the baby and myself bought this for baby 2 i have an about to be 3 year old and a new one on the way had a regular diaper bag with my first and hated it im so in love with this diaper backpack :)
5 5 use these in my 2500sqft two story house and they work perfectly would recommend to anyone who needs nice good quality for a reasonable price 
5 5 really cute 
5 5 for my granddaughter she loves it 
5 5 my kids are always spilling something writing on something or finding other ways to make a mess this seat protect is a must have for my family and fit nicely on the back seat of my 2013 vw passat this product provides great protection and is easy to install i would highly recommend 
5 1 these are very thin and therefore do not absorb much liquid which is the primary purpose of a feeding bib instead i used muslin cloths wrapped around like a bandana and tucked under baby s chin 
5 5 great gate bought additional eyelets so we can use the gate where ever our grand children are playing plan to buy another
5 5 wow now this is a nice seat after searching store after store for a quality booster i finally decided to order the britax parkway sgl online since no store around me carried it this seat latches in securely and the back of the seat is locked in and not going anywhere my wife bought a couple of cheap graco seats for her car and am always annoyed how they fall apart when you take them out and slide around when no kids are in them really cool how the back of this seat slides in and will not fall apart when moving padding is superior to other seats i have looked at 
4 4 i recently added to my cloth diaper stash previously i only had a grovia with 2 regular inserts and 2 hemp they re alright but my baby would usually leak onto the inside of the outer liner so i didn t often get more than 1 use out of it before having to wash despite having 4 inserts so the new cloth diapers i just tried are alva baby ai2 print reuseable washable pocket cloth diaper nappy 2 inserts s09 thirsties duo wrap snap blackbird size two 18 40 lbs with thirsties hemp inserts 2 pack large 18 40 lbs and thirsties one size pocket diaper snap blackbird as for overall fit i like the alva baby best my daughter is 6 months and a little over 20 lbs these fit pretty nicely the snaps are arranged in such a way that the waist fits snuggly without the fabric getting bunched up i m not wild about the micro fiber insert mainly because i can t stand synthetic fabric but it does the job i ve had no issues with leaks or absorption with this and other pocket style cloth diapers make sure you get the insert put in place spread out and flat inside the pocket so it doesn t get bunched up and cause leaks thirsties one size pocket has a superior insert but it would actually work in the alva baby and i m thinking of buying a couple thirsties inserts to use with the alva diaper thirsties one size pocket isn t as nice of a fit as the alva baby imo the reason being the waist snaps aren t arranged as nicely as the alva but otherwise it s equal quality and performance to the alva diaper size wise and fit around the legs seems about the same to me but for the price i d go with alva the duo wrap snap is totally different more along the lines of the grovia except on the duo wrap it s one big flat insert identical to the one size inserts except a little larger and it just lays flat inside the outer liner there is nothing fastening it in place this diaper is better if your baby is too big for the one size pockets or the grovia though it isn t my favourite style i didn t have any issues with leaks though and if you want to use prefolds i think this diaper would be a great choice the outer liner is thin but waterproof so it won t be too bulky with a prefold inside after trying these few different cloth diapers i really prefer the pocket style both thirsties and alva get the job done with no issues no leaks etc but alva is dramatically cheaper and a nicer fit around the waist due to a better snapping style i d recommend buying the inserts for thirsties to go with alva baby if you really want a better insert but the originals do work fine also for use with cloth diapering i highly recommend using something like bumkins flushable diaper liner for catching bm s it makes everything so much simpler just lift it out and toss it in the trash no messy poop cleanup that s the only liners i ve tried but i can t complain hope this helps i ve never had or used those sprayers for getting the poop off into the toilet and before using the liners i just shook the poop off into the trash but the liners make it really easy and they re biodegradable and relatively inexpensive once by baby wets her diapers or poops i never reuse the liners i ve seen some reviews saying they just reuse if it s not too soiled but i don t advise doing that especially if your baby has sensitive skin 
3 3 my wife didn t like the leachco snoogle as much as some of the other reviews there is a great review here about how hard the cover is to put on with the zipper the one i got did not have a zipper instead it is two cases and you wiggle it on from either end and it overlaps in the middle this is probably a better design than a long zipper which i can certainly see being a pain that said it is still kind of a pain to put on 
5 5 the quality is excellent
1 1 first use and it is already leaking somehow water gets trapped below the disk in the bin where you put the water then it leaks out the sides near the light ugh definitely returning 
5 5 very good easy to use and convenient to wash 
5 5 my six month old loves it best toy 
5 5 amazing cup i have been really over using my daughters straw cups and losing all the pieces or trying to keep them clean and wanted something spill proof but simpler and i stumbled across these omg i cant say enough good about them easy to clean and use my daughter is 2 and was a little confused at first but picked it up quickly they are 100 spill proof and after a week of use so far i have nothing but great things to say about them they have been dropped washed in the dishwasher and every other day to day use and so far holding up very well with my destructive toddler you wont be disappointed i just ordered 3 more :)
5 4 sent wrong color than what was ordered which worked out better in the long run other than that great product 
5 5 it works well i like it 
5 5 this cups are awesome however i wish there was a way to choose between girl cups and boy cups i have ordered them for my son twice and have gotten the most girly ones possible both times on the plus side his baby sister can use them when she gets old enough so i am choosing to keep them still need to find some for him though 
3 3 i wanted to like this thing but what a pain in the behind i don t know if i m using it wrong or what but the bendy strip at the top flops around and won t stay in place so i can t get a view of my baby i have bigger boobs and i feel like i am not covered enough i think it has to do with the fact that i have to keep fiddling with the strip at the top so the fabric gets moved around it is very breathable fabric though light and flowy but you cannot see through it at all the pattern is nice as well
5 4 we enjoy reading our new book 
5 5 good product prompt delivery time great price no problem to assembly them you just have to check the picture in the instruction carefully to match the holes no additional tools needed everything is in the whole package 
5 5 the bedding set was even nicer than on line my grandson likes trains and i just happened to see the bedding set on line and he needed a new one 
5 5 love this banana 6 month old won t take any pacifier or anything but he took the banana perfect size for baby and looks like toothbrush end really soothes his teeth gums i do not leave home without now 
5 5 as described 
5 5 i love these diapers for nighttime they usually don t leak until morning after a 12 hour night if at all i use one of the microfiber inserts that came with the diaper and 2 or 3 hemp inserts under that 
5 5 these cups are great though i failed to notice they are not the insulated ones no worry though the girls don t mind 
1 1 this bar grip is useless it does not stay adhered to the wall if you use it for balance it comes off in your hand don t depend on this bar for safety you may break your neck in the shower
5 5 the first one ordered was so good i ordered two more have given two to family members always take one to use when on vacation but the last trip to the smoky mountains it snowed so heavily we had to leave before the roads closed in our haste to leave with the power off and in the dark we left the shower handle alas i ordered another one upon arriving home we hope someone else will enjoy the shower handle left behind as much as we did 
1 1 missing brush and couple nipples
5 5 stays on great and has a wonderful rattle that my baby can notice and hear 
5 5 so far i love this crib i did not experience the smell of paint or any foul odor as some have reported the construction is nice and sturdy we have not yet had the opportunity to convert it as my daughter is 1 but plan to do so in the future it was exactly what we were looking for 
4 4 my puppy broke out once but its because i didnt have it tight enough after my adjustment it s been a clutch and i have no complaints setup took me only minutes only thing that isnt ideal is if you plan on setting it up taking it down often as that will be a pain in the butt to do my space was approx 55 inches wide so this fit perfect and i still have an extension piece def happy with my purchase even though roxy isnt :)
5 5 these pacifiers are my favorite for my son they make it so much easier to find instead of blindly searching around in his crib in the dark for the pacifier 
5 4 i bought this for my 2 year old son and he loves it the only issue i have with it is the bluetooth after 45 minutes goes into sleep mode and blinks which is distracting for him 
1 1 it looks nice at the beginning but just after a few uses the closing mechanism broke doesn t make any sense poor quality product 
4 3 i cracked one of them because i didn t run warm water on it before trying to extract the portion size is perfect and great to know how much your baby is eating but i wish the shape of each portion was different design requirements aside i wish the frozen portions would fit into a smaller container 
5 5 very cute and very good quality all of the crocheted rattles by this company are adorable and make great gifts
5 5 my mom used the pillow and knitted a cover for it along with a blanket for the crib the pillow is so soft and it s just the right size the pillow is quality constructed and should last quite a while chris from the company even inquired about the purchase to see if everything was alright i appreciate that extra attention and it shows that they care thanks 
5 5 excellent gift for my daughter recommended 100 venezuela 
5 5 one problem though no harness on top to keep baby from leaning forward 
5 3 i love the aden anais products but this sleep sack is ok 
5 5 we love this little pillow thank you so much 
5 5 works great i was also impressed with the pen i love the way it writes the cap snaps on and stays on tight if your reading this because your researching stylus buy this now 
5 5 perfect accessory for my baby s snoopy themed room 
5 5 softer and easier to clean than the nosefrida the nosefrida collects snot just behind the tip and i find it really hard to clean that out unless i do it right away and even then it is difficult to do this one the tip is removable so you can truly get a good clean this is such a great feature and the easy i threw out my other snot sucker i like that the filters are compressed and held in place between the top cap and barrel plus it comes with enough filters that i can easily change them every single time i use the aspirator with your baby on their back point the tip towards the floor when you suck towards their spine not up towards their brain it says to do this in the information book and it really works you will get so much more out and it is safe and less irritating on their nasal passages 
4 4 it s really as cute as it looks giving it 4 stars because it s a little small for a standard sized rocking chair and i had to stretch the ties and tie them in weird places to make it fit it is beautiful though and the picture really doesn t do the detail proper justice very happy with this :)
5 5 i arrived well the product is well packaged
5 4 good the change color when the food is hot is a good help
5 5 fast shipping good price
5 5 we were looking to buy my son his first pillow this is the perfect size and i love that it is hypoallergenic 
5 5 good
4 4 i just received this crib it came on the day and in the time range that i had requested putting the crib together was not too difficult and we really like the dark brown color as it matches the other furniture that we have bought lajobi the company that makes bonavita cribs will no longer be making cribs so it will be impossible to get a conversion kit for this crib but the crib was discounted 62 50 which i think was worth not being able to get the conversion kit in a few years the crib was similar to prices we saw at ikea but much better quality in my opinion i was not necessarily looking for a convertible crib though so if that is a must for you then do not buy this crib the crib looks beautiful and it did not have any major defects that we could see the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is b c my baby is not here yet and so i m not sure how she s going to like the crib 
1 5 repaired for my baby 
5 5 best money we ve spent on the kid he doesn t like his bassinet so much i think it s a bit too big and open for him he seems to like the coziness gentle rocking and the incline offered by the rnp it s really a nice little travel bed for him too and easy to fold carry it would be even better if it had a shoulder strap but whatever the first two nights he was home he was really fussy and barely slept after six weeks in the nicu on an inclined bed the third night we opened this package and put him in the rocker he was out for like four hours get one you ll love it 
5 5 perfect and my daughter can t get out of it 
5 5 it s solid and durable my boy has used it from the fifth month to now 
5 5 love this cup 
5 5 i love this dust ruffle high quality fabric and coordinates with other items in the space bot collection easy to put on haven t had to wash it yet but don t expect any problems 
5 5 my 1 and 2 yr old absolutely love their stars before we leave their rooms at night they both ask for theirs stars also my 2 yr old was a nightmare he would get out of bed all night and fuss or play but with his stars now he stays in bed these stars actually light up their whole ceiling and parts of their walls too and their rooms arent tiny so i love that i highly recommend this for toddlers :)
5 5 best high chair out there super easy to clean and our daughter is comfortable in it 
5 2 i will not recommend if you have over a 65 inch opening the gate is pretty heavy and good quality one of the plastic pieces that just fill in a space was cracked we have exactly 72 34 opening and we are going to have to add wood on each side to accommodate the gate because i want to make it work i can t find anything like this other than one of those folded ones which are very expensive 
5 5 very warm
5 5 perfect size for my 2 yr old 
1 2 i am not a fan of this monitor for several reasons too bright too light weight and the interference with wifi1 way too bright even in the lowest brightness this thing is like a light house in the middle of the night it has the voice activation which turns off the screen unless there is a sound but if your baby wakes up in the middle of the night and you try to look at this screen it s like looking straight into the high beams of a semi 2 it s very light weight too light i know light weight is probably something a lot of people aim for the problem is the camera moves with the slightest touch so many times we put the baby down walk out the room and half the crib is out of view of the camera because something moved it also there isn t a very good way of securing it i thought of securing it on a wall like a frame but there s nothing to hang it by 2 b the monitor is also very light weight it s so light that it s own power cord will drag it down you have to make sure you anchor it somewhere 3 the interference at first the interference was not noticeable we have not noticed any interference with cell phone use and most wifi internet use however we did notice interference when streaming video netflix hulu amazon video etc it took us a while to figure out it was the monitor but that s what it is for a long time we thought it was crappy wifi i moved the router got a replacement router moved video streaming devices i even bought a wifi extender long story short we started to notice that whenever we had the monitor on the video streaming was very degraded until one week we accidentally left the power cord at the in laws for a week that entire week no wifi problems when we got the power cord back and started using it again the problems with wifi video streaming returned we tested it out we started watching a movie on amazon streaming and had the monitor on thevideo was low quality and would stop frequently every 2 minutes or so we turned the monitor off within a minute we were back to full hd with no stopping for the rest of the movie this monitor causes interference had i realized sooner that the wifi interference was caused by this monitor i would have exchanged it the other issues were bad but not bad enough to bother spending the money on another monitor now we are getting close to the point where we won t be using it too much anyway if i had to do it again i would not buy this monitor 
5 5 as described 
5 5 loved it 
4 4 i was a little hesitant in buying this on line as you couldn t really get a good picture of it but it was just what i was looking for the cover is made with a thin cloth and would have rather it have been something you could wipe a little better but still if pretty good quality 
5 5 i love this product i bought this to use for my little 3 month old daughter while she had a very bad cold and i was so relieved to be able to help her initially i was mortified by the concept but when your baby is suffering and uncomfortable you ll do anything to help them nothing from your baby s nose comes in contact with you in any way bottom line it works and it works very well 
5 5 great diaper bag plenty of room and pockets inside tons of zippered pouches on the outside the wipe compartment right on the outside is the best part also it s big enough without being ridiculously huge love it 
1 1 did not fit my mclaren tx besides next day after trying to put them on by the instruction wet and and some dish soap inside started stink terribly 
5 5 the trailer arrived quickly and without damage was easy to assemble have not had a chance to tow the trailer so i can not comment on that yet i did pack the bag with all my camping gear to make sure everything would fit and it does very happy with my purchase will update after i pull the trailer a few time loaded 
5 5 my wife loves it
5 5 my three year old loved his 34 blue blankie 34 from pottery barn so i got a second one just incase it went missing after his baby brother came he dug out a baby shower gift and began carrying around his 34 baby 34 everywhere almost lost him once and it was bad insert my search to find a second one incase 34 baby 34 got left somewhere or lost at disney fast shipping perfectly new product with tags thank you 
5 5 love these things 
1 1 a cool idea give it to a toddler and tell him her that they have to hold it by the handle for it not to spill or not to drop it because the bowl will pop put yeah right see how well that works for you it s now a toy box item one step above the trash can save your money 
5 2 overrated 
5 5 my 5 month old son loves this toy i attach it to his jumperoo and it s been his favorite so far 
5 4 a little hard to figure out how to wear it at first i had to practice a bunch and used baby doll to try before i felt comfortable wearing newborn wish i had known about it at birth of my 4 5lb preemie as the ergo and bjorn were too big for her to sit in now she is 7lb and i find the bjorn is just easier but nice fabric nice packaging decent price not adjustable for different sized family members as most carriers are you order the size shirt you would wear
4 3 i guess i can t complain too bad because the price is fair it just isn t very easy for baby to maneuver around in the front wheels are 360 degree but the back ones are only front and back so it makes it hard to get around and he gets stuck a lot which is only upsetting to him so duration of play time in the walker is limited it s even a pain for me to scoot out of the way because of those back wheels i usually just pick it up to move it won t be saving this for next baby 
5 5 i am not a fan of their swaddle pods but i love these we could not have survived the first three months without them they are a great deal and for the amount of washing we did to them they held up great we were swaddle challenged and these make it really easy 
5 5 delivery was incredibly fast was a gift but my daughter said it works great the baby wants the cow so it doesn t stop the door since she plays with it 
3 2 quality product that is strong i like that kids can t just pull it out however neither can myself or my husband without a lot of work it s so hard to get these out of the outlets 
5 5 i loved it
4 4 the monitor was easy to set up and worked perfectly at first then we started getting an error message i contacted customer support and had an excellent response they shipped a replacement unit immediately and followed up to make sure it arrived and that i was satisfied replacement unit is working perfectly i would give the monitor 5 stars if we hadn t had to get a second unit as i think it is a great monitor at a great price but customer support deserves 6 stars 
5 3 adorable good quality and arrived on time but smaller than expected i should have read the dimensions 
5 5 arrived promptly and was exactly as described
5 4 its good 
5 5 works perfectly my daughter s teeth don t pierce through and now i don t have to worry about her consuming the shellac on her crib
3 3 was sent to me in the wrong color which is not that big of a deal i guess luckily i don t care if my son has or uses pink things but some moms would only used it once so far to mash an avocado it did okay my son prefers the creaminess that the blender makes but he took a few bites of it this way 
5 5 we love this roomy pack n play which is so much bigger than the other ones we have a tall baby who scoots around in her sleep so this is perfect for her to sleep over at the grandparents but also play in during the day love it 
5 5 the doll was soft and looked nice my wife purchased it for our 10 month old niece for christmas and she seemed to really like it 
4 4 these do the job plastic is a bit flexible but that works for my needs toddler can t get in to cabinet good buy
5 5 great
5 4 i bought this for christmas for my 6 month old i thought it was hilarious looking and it is in person it sort of looks like a dog toy but is pretty funny to watch your baby chew on it is great texture for teething and chewing 
5 5 it was great it was a gift for my at the time unborn niece nephew and i m sure she is going to love it her mom uom alum sure did 
4 3 its an ok buy for the price my britax stroller did not fit completely i had to remove the wheels so it could fit it did the job though 
5 5 it keeps the baby warm specially in the fall winter time it fits perfect the changing pad and bassinet mattress 
4 5 fits perfectly onto the ikea malm dresser which is slightly too narrow for most changing pads the downside is that baby grew too long within a year but that s not the changing pad s fault now i just change him on the bed floor or anywhere else that he can t injure himself as the dresser would be too dangerous now that he can move around i found it difficult to figure out which cover would fit it before purchasing but this cover fits perfectly http www amazon com gp product b009es00dq 
5 5 no problems whatsoever 
5 3 i like the pacifiers themselves but the color is very light and hard to see in the dark they blend in with the bed sheets too easily and my baby can t find them in his crib at night 
5 1 i was not happy with the purchase it was suposto be personalized with the name zoey no name on it 
5 5 excellent 
5 5 these are my boy s favorite very light weight 
1 2 i think it is too expensive for what you get i was disappointment in the quality 
5 5 we love wubbanubs i didn t want to use pacifiers with my first born but after 2 nights of screaming in the hospital i gave in so her first paci was a soothie when we got home we started using the wubbanub and my daughter learned how to push the paci back in her mouth in just a couple months the stuffed animal has also saved us from dropping wubbanub on the ground numerous times since there is something to catch or sometimes get stuck on something else we washed it in the laundry with natural detergent and let it air dry and never had any problems we give these as gifts to our new mom friends now and no one leaves home without the wub 
1 1 while i love the look of these pacifiers and my baby is very comfortable using them their design is terrible and down right dangerous these pacifiers cannot be thoroughly cleaned or used by a drooling baby without water condensation saliva getting trapped inside there is no way to effectively dry up this water condensation as these pacifiers do not come apart i recently noticed black mildew growing inside all 4 of my babies avent translucent orthodontic infant pacifiers i have since thrown them away there should never be holes or crevices on these pacifiers to allow for moisture to collect in areas that cannot be effectively cleaned and dried very disappointing 
5 3 i have a terrible habit of biting down on the tabs of my daughter s soothies when i m nursing her back to sleep so i don t have to fish around blindly in the dark to find it and they started to fall apart after a couple weeks the nipples are also kinda tough so she doesn t want them as much as the 0 3 month ones 
5 5 baby loves it cool looking just like the one you get from the hospitals 
5 4 awesome alternative to the soothie better shape 
5 5 really cute hold two pacifiers nicely 
5 5 baby grandson s favorite
3 4 its a good pacifier i was expecting the elephant to be heavier it does not keep a good job staying in her mouth like i expected but it is cute 
5 5 best pacifiers ever babies love them 
5 5 baby seems to love it
5 5 good i love it 
5 4 it seems well made but our baby wanted nothing to do with it 
5 5 loved it 
5 5 i ve used nuk pacis for my son and will do again for my soon to be baby girl 
4 4 this is for fun so yes the nipple is a bit on the stiff side
5 5 very cute
5 5 top
5 5 top
5 5 love it
5 5 essential my baby loves this a pain to clean but child loves it so much i deal with it
5 5 we love these binkies they are the only ones my baby takes they don t create pressure on the palette and they re cute my only complaint is that the paint scratches very easily but because of the benefits we will keep using them happily 
5 5 so cute love it my loves it too well at least chewing on it sonit s gs arms and head 
5 3 the clip tends to slip off my diaper bag strap which defeats the purpose of keeping it handy and easy to reach 
5 1 these pacifiers are not the same as the ones you purchase through a retailer my daughter loves this brand and she would not take the ones i purchased on amazon the sucking part is a yellow color and i m not even sure they are silicon 
5 5 my cousin loved this for baby boy 
5 5 great product 
1 1 baby would not take because of the shape 
5 5 my son loves these he takes other pacifiers but doesn t keep them in as well as he does this one i m so glad i decided to try these 
5 5 my baby loves these he can even hold on to them himself and he s only a week old i recommend these 
5 5 very good product 
5 5 very good product 
5 5 i like these better than the nuk brand because they are one piece no water getting in to the middle 
5 4 fun 
5 5 my daughters both hated dummys paci s and never took them i bought this pack for my 4 month old to chew on which she loves to do but never sucks on them they are thicker than the 0 ones that we got from the hospital i am breastfeeding and these are the closest thing to a nipple 
3 2 the ones i got in the mail don t even look like these the base plate of these are solid blue doesnt have the red stripe the logo is a lot smaller and they seem pretty cheap built 
5 5 adorable
5 5 just buy
5 4 it s ok just too pricey for a pacifier
3 2 it s ok my daughter didn t seem to like it but it s cute
5 5 we have been through 3 different types of pacifiers mam traditional with the tilted nipple and the soothie baby a has constantly spit out every pacifier besides the mam baby b really is not that picky but he too holds onto this pacifier as if it was golden breast milk lol the air is perfect for teething babies as well i m not even sure i want to try any other type of mams 
5 3 i just received these and they were not the gumdrop natural scented they are jollypop unscented my baby seems to be ok with them the true test will be bedtime 
5 5 roll tide 
4 4 our babe didn t take to this style of pacifier until he was about 3 months unfortunately but every baby is different of course they are of excellent quality though and we will be buying the next size up for our little guy i docked it a star for not having a nice loop or hole so we could attach a clip easily like this one http www amazon com gp product b007ierg0i
5 1 warning this item in not an authentic wubbanub i purchased because my daughter loves her authentic caterpillar wubbanub this one came in a cheap plastic bag unlike the plastic cylinder that is cute enough to gift like the authentic ones the quality of this one is much cheaper much smaller weighted less than the authentic i also compared the tags on the rear of the animals and the difference is obvious love love love the authentic this one is going back asap hope this helps 
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers as well as the latch bottles everything else would just fall right out of her mouth
5 5 we had several types of pacifiers for our little man and he prefers these by far i went out and bought extra so it s definitely worth it to buy in bulk like this i still would recommend getting a few varieties as your mileage my vary but this is what worked for us 
5 5 our daughter loves her wubbanub i would recommend it to any parents as a great pacifier option 
5 3 so cute
4 5 the only one my 4 month old will use 
5 5 love them
5 5 i love this brand of pacifier my the sanitizing box is a huge plus my baby seems to like this style better than the 34 standard 34 ones 
5 5 so cute 
4 1 way smaller than i thought and you can t change pacifers bc the one that came with it was sewn on not happy with the item considering the price with included tax 
5 4 bought this as part of a christmas gift for my brother and sister in law who are expecting they loved it 
5 5 the best pacifiers i found for my daughter 
5 5 these are fantastic 
5 5 a gift for our new grandson hope it keeps him quiet i mean happy anyway my son was happy with it for his little tyke 
5 5 how am i on my third kid and only just now considered glow in the dark pacis every paci loving baby needs these not only am i able to easily find them in the middle of the night but my baby has learned to find them also which means less help from mama a must have 
5 5 my son loved wubbas but i like this one in particular because it s light and the ease of stuffing it into a jean pocket not all wubbas are equal 
5 5 my baby loves this pacifier it is very thin across the gum line and has a nice size for the bulb she s had other mam pacifiers and this is her favorite i like the design of the plastic outer part as it allows for good airflow i would recommend this pacifier especially parents who use mam bottles the mam perfect pacifier has a truly unique design 
5 3 i shouldn t complain i did not buy this for a baby i bought it for my kitten who insists on suckling my neck i tried to get him to suckle this instead by resting it on my shoulder no go when i wasn t looking one day he chewed the nipple off it and it s too big for him to play with i think there is something about the bright red color that he finds intimidating as well it s the only toy he won t play with 
5 5 given as a gift to expecting parents they loved them
5 1 ew just ew this thing looked bad and smelled worse my dog even turned his nose up at it 
5 5 love love love so cute 
5 5 love it 
5 5 love these
5 5 this puts a whole new perspective on pacifiers i love this product and have ordered three from an early age my baby has been able to get his pacifier and put it back into his own mouth plus the plush animal offers a lot of comfort to him love love love these 
5 5 this bag is going to work great for our new baby it has tons of space and and my wife loves the design 
5 4 my grand daughter likes these pacifiers 
5 5 my son love wubbanub pacifiers theyre the only kind he will use great quality product 
5 4 decal fades shortly after purchasingpacifier next to that is great quality and our son really loves the shape and feel of the pacifier and nipple would recommend and would purchase again
5 5 grandson loves them and like the color 
4 3 would be nice if pacifier was replaceable
5 5 the best invention ever 
5 5 never can have enough of these 
5 5 super cute colors got as a gift because these are the only ones my 3 daughters used 
5 5 only ones my baby likes plus amazon has a great variety
5 5 all good thanx
5 5 this and the soothie are the only pacifiers my daughter has ever taken she s 18 months in a pinch i ve bought the 0 3 months ones but they are very light she prefers the weight of the 3 ones 
5 5 simply the best pacifier for picky babies 
5 5 my son loves it he also has the lion one 
5 5 haha hilarious 
5 4 my baby wasn t too interested in the hospital soothie so we tried these she likes these better and i like the suction free channel i don t know if my baby has an overabundance of cheeks but these leave marks on them 
5 5 bought this for my must have everything giraffe daughter she displays it prodly will all her other giraffe paraphernalia 
5 5 mam is the only bottle i use for my kids it is amazing for nursing moms all my kids transitioned from nursing to bottles and with mam bottles it seems a smooth one after my second child i also discovered that you can sterilize the bottles without the annoying bulky microwave sterilizers you simply take the bottom apart and add some water and then pop it in the microwave for a minute or so amazing the only semi annoying part is that sometimes if you don t put the bottom back properly it leaks but by the third child i just wash them in the dishwasher and don t even bother to take it a part the dishwasher is great since it cleans the bottom very well without any mildew or anything my kids also love mam pacifiers and always look at me if i try to give them a different brand as if 34 what are you giving me this is not the one i like 34 great products altogether big fan 
5 5 love this
5 5 exactly as advertised great deal and good quality and fast shipping will definitely recommend and come back soon thanks again 
5 5 my lo loved it 
5 5 this was the only binky my baby would use i have no idea why he loved it so much but i tried several others and he rejected them all the only bad thing is they are hard to find 
5 2 pacifier keeps falling off 
5 5 very useful
5 5 loved it definitely a favorite gift for my grandson 
5 5 i love these i don t have to worry about losing binkies all over the place 
5 5 just a replacement baby loves her 34 grenouille 34 
5 5 we had the giraffe wubbanub until my older child misplaced it so we ordered the brown puppy as a back up we ironically found the giraffe the day this one came my baby love this binky just as much as the giraffe they are the only two binkies he ll take they are also harder to lose and easy for the baby to grab and manipulate themselves we recommend wubbanubs to all of our new parent friends 
5 5 my kid loves his wubbanub these things are great 
5 4 looks really funny
5 5 i will forever love this little thing because of how much my baby loved it during her first few months now she s nearly 9 months and since about 5 months old she s refused to use it as an actual paci and chews on it instead if we didn t have it with us during those early days i would get a little antsy because i knew how much my baby relied on it to soothe herself now i will say this it s white which is probably not the best color choice when it comes to a kid s toy and if i knew that it d look pretty dirty even after washing it many times i may have gotten one that would hide the bit of grubbiness but it is a very sweet little lamb and i ll be keeping it as a keepsake for her 
5 5 my baby loves this 
5 5 love it 
5 5 babies love these they can play with the animals as they fall asleep 
5 5 love that these come with covers
5 5 great design for a product 
5 5 my daughter likes them 
5 5 the only brand our lactation consultant recommends now the only kind our daughter will take love these 
5 5 baby love it 
5 5 i give wubbanub s as gifts to people with new babies for very good reason new born s won t use them but after about the 2nd month the parents realise why i gave them this thing :)
3 5 i purchased this for our nuby soothie pacifiers i read the reviews and was a bit concerned with many reviews saying that it was very difficult to open some saying impossible i was concerned as i have fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars heavy doors and other things with my hands i took the chance and bought one hey it was only 3 99 with free shipping when i received the case i immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but i found a more than easier way to open the case if you squeeze the two sides of the case it instantly pops open i barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open yes i realize the latch should be easy to open but i found this way worked and seems to be a great way this easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case the clip is a little flimsy but i believe it s made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere i think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn t fall off although i have not had the problem of it falling off it s so wonderful i purchased another one 
5 5 we are very happy with these pacifiers they really glow at night good choice 
5 5 new aunt
5 5 our baby loves these third one we purchased
5 5 as usual same quality from advent classic we all love i just bought this bottle because it is limited edition and i needed to stand out from the other moms who use the classic bottle 
3 3 i bought this because it seemed to be the 34 greenest 34 best option for a pacifier but it looked weird felt weird was not comfortable at all big bulky and heavy plus my daughter was just never interested in pacifiers so we ended up not using them at all :(
5 5 bought for my future niece nephew dad to de thinks its awesome it may be more of a novelty paci vs an everyday go to but it is right up their alley 
5 4 baby really likes this pacifier it does smell like rubber but that doesn t seem to bother her the size is right as is the pliability and mommy likes that it is all natural plus baby likes that she can grasp the handle and take it out or put it in when she wants this one is a winner worth the price 
1 1 these are not the hawaii medical gumdrop pacifiers they are jolly pops which are not as soft as the gumdrop pacifiers my baby would not take these buyer beware 
5 5 these are by far my favorite pacifiers we just had our third child and i picked some up yet again i like to give them a quick 34 charge 34 with the flashlight app on my phone and i can easily find it in the dark so as not to wake up a fussy sleepy baby 
5 5 grand daughter loved it and i could find it 
5 5 super cute and makes the baby look absolutely hilarious 
5 5 great quality 
5 5 this thing is so cute it s a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be but i don t know why i expected it to be bigger it is for a baby after all duh but we have a brand new baby and this stays in his mouth so much better than a normal pacifier he folds his little hands over it and it looks like he is snuggling it sooooo adorable 60 3 60 3 60 3
5 5 i bought this paci when my son was about 2 3 months old because i thought it was super cute my son is now 8 months and has yet to use it he stopped using his pacifier around 2 months old so i never got around it giving it to him i still think it s so cute 
5 5 these are great pacifiers if my son takes them out of the house at least one person is always commenting on how cute they are my son uses the monkey as a comfort lovie in addition to just sucking on the pacifier 
5 4 i am using these for my 5 weeks old baby boy the nipple is softer shorter and it has a couple of grooves for him to latch on the only drawback is that it marks his face 
5 5 my son loves this type of pacifier i love how once he was old enough to put it in his mouth the giraffe helped him to find it in the dark so he could put it in his mouth himself this type of pacifier on its own will bounce a good distance if tossed or spit out by baby however the giraffe helps minimize the bounce factor to about zero well worth the investment that we bought a second one in case the first one was lost or misplaced so far haven t had to pull out the backup one after almost a year 
5 5 best option for nursing baby if choose to give pacifier despite being a strong believer in nursing and therefore originally adamantly opposed to using a pacifier i learned pacifiers are helpful for some children these were recommended by occupational therapists to help baby learn to suck also good for oral development at times easy to sanitize simple reliable 
4 5 baby loves these things but so does the dog just means we need to order more i guess the nipple will invert slightly as well so when you are trying to ween baby off of the soother you can do that and then after a while cut the stuffed animal off the soother part baby isn t old enough for that for me yet but i m looking forward to see if that works 
5 5 little guy loves them 
5 5 parents everywhere will be using this to break the paci addiction just add bitter medicine and in no time your toddler will fear the paci 
4 4 kid loves it reason for 4 star is when you need to clean it stuffed animal is sewed to the pacifier i have to wash it in washing machine 
5 5 keeps em quiet and nice
5 5 it s ok
5 4 for me the only thing missing from this is a way to separate clean pacifiers from dirty ones 
5 3 good
5 5 i like it 
5 5 liked it
5 4 way too funny 
5 5 love how they glow in the dark easier to find in the dark 
5 5 the wubbanubs are cute and my granddaughter and great niece love them with the animals attached to the pacifier they are easy to find when they decide to throw them down 
5 3 takes a long time to start taking tempature 
4 3 wish the pacifier detached from zebra to clean
5 5 works great for our picky newborn who hates a 34 classic 34 type of pacifier she even likes to hold onto this pacifier when it s in her mouth i like the fact that this pacifier is made from one solid piece of material and is easy to clean would recommend 
5 3 none available 
5 5 favorite pacifier hands down very light weight and stays in my sons mouth when he was younger 4 months or so he did get his finger stuck in the little hole so beware once he had enough coordination to handle the pacifier it wasn t a problem 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 adorable and baby loves it
5 5 very cute
5 1 my daughter hated these they have zero scent and they are nothing like the one the hospital gives you these are extremely stiff and not soft at all 
5 5 i love it beyond cute and my kids enjoy cuddling with there giraffe
5 5 my 3 month old loves them 
5 5 love theses pacis 
5 5 arrived quickly and as described 
5 5 only ones my baby likes 
5 5 if you have a binky kid you know how important these are 
5 5 excellent product i bought these for my first granddaughter now for my 2nd granddaughter great quality i would buy again 
5 5 love them great quality shape is big enough for a 6 months baby tried nuk left marks on baby s face nice msg makes me happy by looking at them handy to have the case to sterilize the dummy at anywhere with a microwave great purchasing 
5 5 love it 
5 5 my nephew loves his long horn bull soother he can cuddle it while he falls asleep fur is soft and the bull is a good shape he s a nice weight and feels good in your hands 
5 5 bought this for my nephew he loves the soothie pacifier it safely rested on his tummy and kept it in is mouth when he suck really hard they normally shoot away when he started teething he chewed all over this thing 
5 4 the sticking of the item isn t that great on the center seam of the caterpillar but this item was really cute and is great for our 2 5 mo niece who is breast fed only and is having a hard time taking to a pacifier and bottle the caterpillar helps keep the pacifier in place when she gets in to the habit of sucking on it constantly and keeping it in her mouth it s super cute her mom also love it the actual pacifier is soft material too 
5 5 my newborn has been picky with pacifiers she loves these and we have tried every brand 
5 5 my grandaughter grandson love the wubbanubs 
5 5 these are as close to the hospital ones as i could find my baby loves them and i actually like these better than the hospital one because the hole on the ring is big enough for me to put my finer thru so that i can hold it without getting germs on the nipple 
5 5 these soothe my baby so i love them i wash by hand and haven t had any problems yet nice that it comes with a little clear plastic cover that snaps over the nipple part since these tend to attract fuzz however one cover broke fairly quickly 
5 5 great products
5 5 we had the dragon one of these but my little one bit the end of the paci off and he doesn t sleep with out it so we got a new one the monkey it s very soft much softer than the dragon was my little one seems to love it just as much as the dragon they are machine washable and can be dryed on low heat :(
5 5 quality product that is true to description
5 5 it is as described and works great 
5 5 my son loves this thing it is a life savor and it helps me keep the pacifier in his mouth 
5 5 love
5 5 love it 
5 5 as advertised my daughter just didn t like them
5 4 the wubbanub brand has come highly recommended by other moms i m expecting my first child so i can t say how the baby will like it but this kitty pacifier is great in my opinion perfect size for a baby and the shape of the kitten should allow my baby to hold on to it well can t wait to see it in use 
5 5 we have 3 wubbanubs and by far this one is my favorite because it is wide and flat so it stays in place better since my little one has issues with sucking i swaddle him tight and put the wubbanub under the blanket if he turns his head he can turn back and find it again with our other wubbanubs they wobble and don t stay in place as well when he is awake he does like the dinosaur best because it is thin and easier for him to hold but this one does the trick for sleepy times 
5 5 it was great
5 5 works great for our 3 months old and i love that they glow so i can find it in the night without using a light 
5 5 i love this pacifiers
5 5 my son was born with prs and these are the only pacis that work for him and his high palete he can hold it in his mouth and create suction love them 
5 5 shipped fast with prime product as advertised 
5 5 our daughter loves these and they seem to hold up really well 
5 5 this is our most favorite wubbanub my son will only use ducky and lamby and i m not sure what we would do without them i buy this for all new mommies that i know my son loves to hold onto lamby s ears and ducky s arms and it s amazing in the middle of the night how he can hold onto these guys and feel for them in his crib when they fall out of his mouth 
5 5 my son loves them
4 5 cute streamlined gets the job done since i only paid six dollars it gets all five stars i do have to be careful if diapers are sopping wet but it can handle my son s usual heavily damp diapers just fine 
5 5 my grandson loved it great product
5 5 my son loves this guy he uses it every nigh to go to sleep its also cute i have nothing bad to say 
1 2 very disappointed i searched for girl pacifiers and was excited to find the 34 dots 34 pattern pictured when delivered they were boy animal print the patterns received weren t even pictured as a choice in the listing misleading 
5 5 arrived fast exactly as described
5 5 lil one loves it silicone and bpa free 
5 5 absolutely love my lil nephew adores it can t get it out of his grip super easy to find if he does drop it or if mommy n daddy set it down 
5 5 good nuk pacifier cute design 
5 5 my daughter loves these and this was the only place i could find them
5 5 this is very similar to the ones that they use at the hospital it does not have the typical bulb shape that is flexible instead the plastic of the entire pacifier is sturdier in the babies mouth the pacifier does not bend and catch on the babies gums because of this the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep this is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self soothe at night time as i mentioned earlier the shape and texture are different very similar to a thumb since this is so similar to the thumb your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb while this can be good because they will stop using the pacifier on their own it can be a problem if they continue to suck their thumb months later 
5 5 love these bottles
5 5 good buy
5 5 excellent as desvribed
5 4 good product
5 5 very nice 
5 5 cute bought for shower present 
5 5 perfect 
5 5 my son loves this he s used it everyday for going on 2 months now it s the only binky we haven t lost i wish he would take a different kind of binky as the rubber catches on everything and comes out of his mouth easily but besides that the weight and length of this one is perfect 
5 4 love the idea and loved it more when my son took to quickly i do wish the animal had a tiny bit of weight to it so those wandering flailing newborn hands couldnt just flip it off of them but now at 6 weeks my son has grown accustomed to holding the frog i do see more of these in our future 
5 4 very cute not really weighted enough to keep the pacifier in the mouth but my son woul hug the lamb and it helped it stay in his mouth 
5 5 won t take any other kind my daughter refuses lol
5 5 my baby loves these i was given some as a gift ended up getting several more it is helpful to have a few on hand i tried a few other brands put these are baby boy s favorite i breastfeed and found these to be good shape and caused no confusion they are easy to clean with no extra parts that could fall off they can be used with pacifier clips since they have a hole on the side of them the ones for younger infants are softer 
5 3 none available 
2 2 not as pictured
5 5 thank you 
3 5 ok
5 5 very cute and nice quality i bought these as a gift and was very happy with them 
5 5 only pacis my daughter will take 
5 5 is exactly what i expected
5 5 holds up like a tank after years of use and frequent washings 
5 5 love this product i have a blind child and its a wonderful toy for him 
5 5 excellent seat for my 11 month year old 
5 5 not as soft as bear and lamb nice music 
5 5 good quality nice design like zipper on back lasted throughout mom and baby s needs 
4 4 these work really well but can be tricky to install on non modern cabinets i accidentally installed the magnetic part too close to the latch part and my cabinet stuck closed i had to use a butter knife and hammer to knock it back just enough so that it would unlatch properly and i could get the door opened again the knife hammer combo rendered that latch unusable and had to be replaced with a new one lesson learned i m not sure how you would ensure this wouldn t happen other than moving the moving latch away from the catch as far as possible and slowly adjusting them closer and closer until they catch i have a 1960 s kitchen with partial inset doors i was able to get everything aligned right eventually but it took me about 20 30 minutes for one door i gave up trying to do the others 
5 5 cute
5 5 can t live without this stuff the best cleanup tool for poopy diapers 
5 5 bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it sit in it to read her books drink her milk in the morning watch her shows she loves it and i do to very well made made in the usa the only thing we had to assemble was putting the wooded rocker pieces on the bottom material is really nice and you can tell it was well made not cheap looking at all 
5 5 product is very good 
5 5 love them great flushable poop catcher way better than the other brand bumpkins we bought 
5 5 a big hit a xmas perfect fit to size warm yet not so hot that they wake up hot grandkids loved them
5 5 this product works exactly as described 
5 5 perfect easy to assemble 
5 5 purchased as a gift for a dear friend she loved it 
5 5 i purchased this blanket for my now 4 year old before she was born the blanket is very soft and was perfect for a newborn and my daughter still uses it to wrap and cover up her baby dolls this blanket has withstood countless trips through the washing machine and dryer and still shows practically no signs of wear i m very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this blanket 
3 5 much smaller than it appears in pictures disappointed
5 3 you can see the glue behind 
5 5 so cute
5 5 super cute and a great price 
3 1 as other reviewers have stated this is not very powerful its size is nice but it just doesn t do the job 
5 5 exactly what i needed 
5 5 great
5 5 precious and so soft i love it 
5 5 this is a must have if you have a little one at home i have not seen these sold at walmart target jewel etc so consider investing in one before your baby gets sick you won t be able to run out to the local store to pick one up in desperate times this aspirator does not come with a filter instead you can use tissue or toliet paper to block the mucus from entering the tube that leads to your mouth no worries that you ll end up with boogers in your mouth to use this first sterilize all of the pieces with either a quick dunk in boiling water or the dishwasher put the pieces back together open the egg shaped part and put a loosely bunched tissue in close the egg shape container spray your little ones nose with a saline spray wait 30 seconds 1 minute for the snot to soften have the mouth piece in your mouth and move the pointer attached to the egg shape part into the tip of the nose and suck gently repeat 2 to 3 times in necessary according to a conversation i had with my doctor do not do this repeatedly throughout the day when they are sick yes their noses are constantly be filled with mucus and it is possible to aggravate with the spray and aspirator try to do this before they eat it will make eating a lot easier for them they will be able to eat more and have less bubbles get into their system and before bed so that it will be easier for the to fall asleep make sure that you clean after each use 
5 5 new aunt 
5 5 excellent sounds easy to use 
5 4 so far my kiddos love these cups they are not leaking yet and hold the perfect amount of liquid so far so good 
5 5 love the kiinde system
5 5 my wife bought this i bought a different stroller thinking i knew better my was wrong my wife was right this is durable and the most compact as i have seen yet for a double stroller for infants click connect would be nice rather than straps but not worth trading up in size or weight 
5 3 a gift to friend
5 5 my grand nephew and his grandpa loved it 
5 5 i have not used this bag just yet i m not due until end of april 2015 but based on the quality and space in the bag it s awesome there are so many compartments to use for your personal items and of course for the baby it is very light weight and the handles are short so my husband can carry it by the handles or i can carry it on my shoulders there is also a longer strap where you can wear it cross body or on the shoulder and the built in stroller straps are pretty neat they are velcro so i think that should make a strong hold when attached to the stroller it s a stylish yet functional bag that i can t wait to use once my little one arrives 
1 1 i wish i could give it zero stars it s always blinking or flashing green lights can t go upstairs without static after six months it crapped out and it needs battery replacement even though it s constantly plugged into the wall 
5 5 great
5 5 great for wine glasses once you are done with bottles
5 5 excelente producto
5 5 i absolutely love these diapers i m a first time mom and a single one at that and was nervous about all of time and effort needed for cloth diapers these are the easiest things i have ever used and the fact that they are adjustable makes it even better i had priced similar ones at buy buy baby and other places and these seem to be the best priced ones as well 
5 5 i love this thing my son has had countless hours of fun since getting it from 34 santa 34 christmas morning he is normally very active but refuses to nap for me since he has been going in this he gets so tired he falls asleep in two weeks his legs have become stronger he s more vocal and i really feel like he feels like he s more independent super easy to put together took less than 5 min great buy 
5 5 awesome
5 5 stop reading the reviews and just order this thing i d been using the bulb aspirator on my 3mo old and she was hating it this product worked in seconds removing a couple tough boogers that had kept her from sleeping and nursing well for days she hardly noticed the nose piece when i used it on her since it was soft and shaped right for her little nose it worked so fast i surprised myself and she giggled i also dig that the company sent a little card saying they were a small company and that reviews would help them keep
5 4 silver piggy bank
5 5 this is a great product no mess and it s so easy to use
5 5 love this back pack it s cute factor is off the charts it fits my 2yr old niece perfectly i really like that it has a buckle on the front 
5 5 excellent
5 5 works beautifully quickly gets mucus out of infants 
5 5 my son loves this book 
5 5 this lovely monster is the best friend of my daughter easy to use it trend bright colors and the most importent thing i have no problems with snacks scattered around the house daughter can not open the the cap itself but soft monsters teeth make it easy to get cookies 
3 4 this is incredibly cute but the sounds from each ring are not the same decibel in fact the pig squeals and the frog ribbits are very very faint to the point that they are non existent to an 8 month old she adores the giggle from the top though and the cow s moos greatly interest her somewhat overpriced 
5 2 baby didn t want anything to do with it
5 5 great 
4 4 very easy to use it seems to be accruate i have tested it by using both this infrared ear thermoneter and the traditinal one which give the same results i would give it a 5 star rating if i m able to evaluate its durability after using it for a year or more would recommend purchasing
5 5 excellent looks great in crib
5 5 i have sold this product on my website i have also used this product for my own children my husband is on the medical field and has spoken to the inventor it has indirect airflow so it will not harm your child we used saline spray first to loosen the mucus small children cannot blow their nose therefore sinus issues can easily turn into a chest cold from post nasal drip this product will help keep sinuses clear in all honesty it seems like a strange product but it is probably the best gadget i ever had for my kids 100 approve very helpful tool for parents 
5 5 good
5 5 this doesn t have much structure but works as an extended sun shade for our old model stroller that has a small sunshade yes you need a sun shade to attached this too so say if you lost your shade for an infant carrier this will not work to replace it 
5 5 i was so excited when i saw this at my sisters that i decided to get one too i love lion king so i thought this would be perfect for my little one i wish it did come with a remote but i can live without it 
5 5 love this bed i got this for a second bassinet for our house and it is perfect i love that the entire bassinet part is made of fabric and can be completely cleaned in the washing machine quickly and easily the colors are so cute and my little one loves the hanging toys our baby had reflux and can t lay flat to sleep and this bed has an incline that keeps him happy while he sleeps 
5 5 good price easy install 
5 4 good crib no complaints one of the wood pieces was bowed out but we were able to put it all together and the piece in question straightened out 
5 4 my grandson loves this he would not sleep with the lights off before 
5 2 worked sorta but as new parent you just learn to have a diaper handy to catch rogue pee 
5 5 beautiful frame everybody love it 
5 2 i have two of these seats so bought two of the straps after carrying the seats through two airports the clip on one strap broke they also never sat right on my shoulder and became unbearable to carry after a while i recommend getting a luggage cart and a couple of bungee cords rather than these 
5 5 the one and only 36 years ago our daughter was a pacifier pioneer this is the only kind she would take i have a young friend that i order these for her and after trying so many others now it is the only kind her son will take 
5 1 does not fit the mam brand good uncomfortable for my baby to use 
5 5 so cute 
5 5 love this wubbanub the giraffe s neck means the pacifier can be positioned easier than some of the others 
5 5 the item was given as a christmas gift the recipient is very happy with it 
5 4 too funny great photo ops
5 5 cute as can be 
5 5 the only kind my baby likes and they are adorable small inside so it doesn t gag him :)
1 1 tastes like rubber baby hated it very small ball nub to suck and hard to latch to and breath as it smashes babies nose 
5 3 could not get baby to take these my baby was able to use nuk successfully so i don t think its a pacifier issue with him 
2 2 the babies wouldn t take them 
1 4 these gumdrop pacifiers are the only type my baby will take my older daughter used the mam pacifiers but my baby hated those and spit them right out i was desperate one day because my baby was crying and fussing despite being fed changed and burped i had received one of these sample pacifiers in the mail so i popped it in her mouth and she immediately quieted down started sucking and fell asleep i ordered this 5 pack right away after that and have not been disappointed the only thing i do not like is that this brand does not make a pacifier clip i ended up using a jj cole pacifier loop that can loop through the hole on the end and then clip to her clothing also these pacifiers can be a little tricky to clean so i use the narrow end of a bottle brush to clean them and then sterilize them in the microwave works just fine for me but does take extra time 
5 5 great paci i m lo loves it 
5 5 calms my baby down right away it seems a little big for her so i am thinking of also trying the gumdrop ones 
5 5 very goood
5 5 this little bear is so soft and cuddly perfect size for my four month old the color is a little lighter than in the picture i like the actual color better than the one pictured very happy 
5 5 great bib for any police officer to be i wish they had more police officer related items like this my son loves it and husband got a kick out of it 
5 5 omg talk about money well spent i wasn t expecting that much when i purchased this pacifier but wow the mustache part of the paci was made very well almost like a soft silicone texture 
5 5 i love this it fits perfectly on my changing table topper on the dresser i ordered it s exactly what i expected love it would definitely recommend to a friend 
5 5 very good sticks well and lots of colours
5 5 so my 10mo old can use a straw cup but doesn t know how to tilt up a regular cup yet i think i ve bought every one they make so here s my review nuby flip n sip strong valve so no leaks hard to suck she got frustrated very easily with this originally and i even find it hard to suck she doesn t seem to get these handles munchkin click lock flip top medium valve no leaks no handles which we seem to need fairly easy suck one of our go to s for water munchkin click lock straw light valve no leaks no handles easy suck likes to chew on the straw one of our go to s for water munchkin click lock weighted straw light valve no leaks unless you don t screw lid on correctly loves handles likes to chew on the straw weight works well if you squeeze the straw while running water through the weight you can clean it pretty well comes with a straw cleaner i like that it s clear first cup she ll drink milk out of i think this is our favorite sometimes i kind of prime it for her with the first drink wish it had oz markings zo li bot straw no valve but closed straw so easy suck leaks only if tossed just right on the floor dribbles a bit if on side otherwise similar to nipple easy to hold handles comes with a straw cleaner she s not keen on milk in it but drinks water well i like that it s clear and has oz markings lollacup no valve open straw easiest suck this is just a cup with a straw the straw may have a weight on it but it s short and stiff and doesn t move she likes it i haven t tried milk in it 
5 5 this the first time i ve tried dry skin brushing my skin feels much better 
1 1 these fit snug into some of my wall outlets but not all my 9 month old was able to pull them right out 
5 5 like how these stand on their own easy to use and write on freeze well
5 4 cute toy my 1 yr old nephew liked it and my 9 yr old son enjoyed playing with him with it you put the 5 balls in and then they com out the bottom and the yellow part spins there are 4 ramps that can be closed off so the balls can com out right to you or all over fun lights and sounds and the monkey goes up and down 
5 5 i purchased this for my britax car seat it fits great it is very easy to put on take off and it keeps my son very warm in this cold weather it s so much easier than having to carry a blanket around with you i m very happy with this purchase 
5 5 great product
5 5 great for traveling
5 5 my nephews 6 and 4yr old it 
3 3 these weren t sticking like i wanted it to but i still use them
5 5 been on two trips and so far so good holds our chicco car seat and mountain buggy nano at the same time 
5 4 this stacker is absolutely adorable and my son loves it more than his previous ones because he always goes to this one first he really enjoys the little black and white spotted stopper on top too he spins it around and uses it like a ball too the only downside to this is that because the rings are different shaped or odd shaped rather it is more difficult to get back together so they all fit on it and so the topper does too my 5 year old step son even had a harder time although he was lazy when trying lol overall a cute toy and my son and i were like it 
4 4 the sticking wears off after a few days but overall it looks nice and keeps babies head safe when bumping the table 
5 5 worth the price d
5 5 chair works great child must be buckled in chair light weight and easy to travel with would like to be able to ajust distance from table to baby may help child sit up and not slid down in seat the dining tray is a good option to have works great on our table 
5 5 good purchase
3 3 overpriced but quality is ok 
5 5 i am very happy with the graco pack n play playard so easy to set up my daughter loves it as well i purchased it for her 
5 5 easy to put on bath spout verrry cute love it 
5 1 it s tiny and looks like a toy glass not worth the 5 i should have looked closer at the description 
5 4 it s a great product but the motor is loud and suspect this is my second swing the first one gave away after about a year it put our babies to sleep though which i loved 
5 4 love the jumperoo wish that all 360 had more fun activities 
3 5 ok
5 5 i was very skeptical when i bought this for my 4 month old who has started to teeth he loves it it is smaller than i bought it would be but it is just the perfect size for my little man there is beeds in the feet but it dosnt bother me because it seems well put together 
5 3 the eye cover is too small 
5 5 my baby who is ebf doesn t usually like pacifiers but he really likes this one unfortunately so does our dog who ate the other one in this set 
5 5 these work great hospitals use them and they re the only pacifier my daughter would take 
5 5 we literally tried 7 different kinds of bottles and finally we found this one this is the one my daughter actually drank from she hated dr browns please try this bottle if your child is not feeding well i love mam bottles oh and make sure it has the vent system like these have so much easier to clean than dr browns too i can say enough how amazing these are my child finally ate again without choking or gagging 
5 5 convenient and better than using the regular wipes on them
5 5 we love our wubba nubs they are perfect for newborns because they help to keep the pacifier in place and our now 7 month old loves it and can put it in on her own they are so cute and easier to find in the dark or the diaper bag than a small pacifier our ella bella got torn from the soothie at day care and mary meyer replaced it for us for free one of our favorite baby products this is a great gift adorable and so useful 
5 5 perfect pacifier for my baby
5 4 my little one loves his dragon 
5 5 i hope that this will be accurate and easy for my son s growing family will be able to use it 
5 5 these are great and my grandson loves them there is an entire menagerie of animals to choose from but be aware that there are two different age groups for the pacifiers i would think that the added weight of the animal would be a problem but so far it it not it makes it easier for parents to hold on to also and it doesn t fall out of baby s mouth so easily when they re sleeping 
3 3 cute idea just paid to much 
5 5 the go to pacifier helps keep it in baby s mouth and something for them to grasp my daughter loves it 
5 5 perfect for our 3 month old
3 2 the nursing baby does not like 
5 5 this is a beautiful starter bottle set my baby loves the bottles and i love them because they are easy to clean my baby also prefers the pacis that come in this set to other name brands 
5 5 we initially bought some of these as a joke for my son but it turned out that they are the only ones he will use great price on amazon and can t beat free two day shipping prime we constantly get compliments on them wherever we go 
5 5 we owned these from the store and they are exactly the same too bad my grandson decided he was done with pacifiers one week later
3 3 my son doesn t seem to like these as well as the 0 3 month version
5 5 the philips avent nighttime infant it s a great pacifier 
5 5 very good
5 5 i love these pacifier wipes my daughter only used a pacifier for about 5 months but i actually used these things for everything until she was almost 2 toys that would fall on the ground wiping down her high chair the thing i used them most for was wiping down my breast pump at work i m not sure if this is recommended but i felt comfortable doing it since these are food grade wipes i would pump 3 times at work so after each session i d give all the parts a quick wipe down before storing them in my cooler i didn t have enough time to wash and sanitize everything each time but since all sessions were completed within 6 hours wiping them down and storing in a cooler was a good time saver and we never had a problem i ll be doing the same with my second due in a few months 
5 5 adorable
5 5 good 
5 5 my 1 25 yr old son is obsessed with his 34 bubba 34 
5 5 it s an amazing product my daughter loves the lamb it s her favorite 
5 5 baby loves these 
3 4 cute but the glow is pretty weak 
5 1 there is no curve for the teeth it s just one straight nipple
5 5 worked great for my 7 month olds 
5 5 i love it
2 2 with so much going on with the baby shower i didn t open this until the day of you have to cut out all of the pacifiers by hand and adhere tape to them i wish the description would have said so the blindfold broke we fixed it then it broke again the elastic band is only wrapped around a small cut in the thin cardboard if you bought this at the dollar store it would be worth the money but otherwise you d be better off printing off your own items 
5 5 i got these as spares for my son when he was little i froze these for when he was teething i would recommend them to anybody 
5 5 this is the second wubbanub i have purchased my son loves his wubbanub so much and i ve noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night and he loves to hold onto it the bull is adorable too 
5 5 great quality 
5 5 my newborn will only take the hospital style soothes and i was so glad to see these sold on amazon i love that they come in a pretty purple and pink color for her :)
5 5 best pacifier ever we go through 5 pacifiers a week until someone got us this as a present it is the only pacifier that stayed with us for six months attaching a stuffed animal to it is genius 
5 4 our kid would not sleep on the pad that came with our graco pack n play because it was not firm enough his crib mattress is very firm we were going on a trip and so we decided to try this to help us get him to sleep during our trip it fit snug was very firm and was very light it does not roll up so that limits the transport options i e getting it on a plane but for the price it really worked well for us we also just used the regular pack n play sheets without issue 
2 2 i m not too impressed with these buti pods one arrived with a tear on the seam and overall it doesn t seem like they ll last very long also the zipper doesn t slide too easily and often times requires two hands which can be difficult when trying to juggle a baby and everything else that goes along with one 
5 5 exactly what i was looking for no cutesy designs just a good bib with an absorbent top waterproof liner and a soft back for droolers these bibs are a must you can even tuck them under the clothing to keep the little one dry the absorbent layer seems to wick moisture from the clothing and the soft under layer is comfy against their skin for kids with special needs who may have trouble managing their secretions and drool a lot these are a must 
5 5 well made grandkids love it 
5 4 i love these bandanas they are so much cuter than regular bibs our son has to wear one every day because the amount he drools from teething the best part is they add to an outfit rather than take away from cute clothes like regular bibs not a five only because they tend to bunch up in front of his face wash nicely and have worn great 
5 5 just what we needed and it arrived in good time thanks 
5 5 our son sleeps in a sleep sack every night this one is the perfect weight year round not too heavy or too light the way it zips makes it easy to get on and off this is especially nice in the middle of the night there is enough room for our son to kick his legs and be comfortable seems to be good quality and holds together when washed definitely would buy another one 
5 4 the perfect way to introduce baby to friends and family she doesn t get to see on a daily basis she always picks this book out to 34 read 34 as the faces are fun to look at and there aren t very many words the cover is cloth and has gotten dirty and worn so i do wish there were an alternative material 
5 5 pretty awesome bed my niece loves it when she comes over she asks for her bed very cute bed
3 1 i ordered the fast flow nipples but received the slow nipples 
5 5 very easy to put together no tools needed love it
5 5 cheap but does the job just right easy to clean 
5 1  34 no leak 34 my foot leaked like crazy i replaced it with the take toss for straw cups and the munchkin 360 spillproof for when i need the no leak no spill feature 
5 5 love these just like the one that was given to us by the hospital just be aware that these are different than the 3 month ones the 0 3 month pacifiers are thinner where as the 3 month ones are tougher and thicker my son loved his original hospital pacifier and i bought the 3 month one as a replacement and he hated it 
5 5 item delivered on time was as described
5 5 smaller than i expected but my daughter loves it and refuses a larger pillow even though she is three now 
5 2 these are cute and colorful there is a chip of plastic missing on the lip of the cup which is greatly disappointing and i couldn t return it due to it being a christmas present from santa i m not sure how well the image will hold up with actual use and washing so i recommended that my child use it in their play kitchen as play dishes also i just found it at walgreen s for 5 99 regular price so i paid twice as much my five year old is more than happy with it so that s what matters 
5 5 just as described my son in law loved it large enough to hold a big lunch but not too big to carry easily 
4 3 2 stars for adorable diapers and very easy to use they really weren t as absorbaet as i had hoped the microfiber is a little bit of a pain i did all of the prep work and they still didn t work well for me i hope you have better luck if you decide to go with these 
5 5 colorful easy to setup my baby loves it 
5 5 i love these bottles the nipple is designed to be more like mothers breast vs other nipple that are straight great for babies that are breast fed i also like that fact that you can transition it to a sippy cup with a handle and sippy nipple top as they grow 
5 5 my 5 month old loves this it helps him stretch and strengthen his little legs 
5 3 as a first time mother i didn t know what is a good carrier but i found this brand at the local store and decide to order it online since they have the nicer color i rarely used it since it doesn t seem to support the baby wight too well i could only have my baby in this for a short period as my back and shoulders would hurt look wise it looks great but not really the best to carry baby around for long period of time 
5 5 my son had baby eczema from birth until now his pediatrician had prescribed him cortisone cream for his red dry itchy patches behind his knees elbows ankles etc i started using this body shampoo was along with the lotion and it worked wonders you can t even tell he has eczema besides for the occasional barely noticeable patch on his leg i buy in bulk and it last me months its a bit pricey but i highly recommend with the use of eczema or other baby skin conditions 
5 4 we made the decision to cloth diaper while i was still pregnant we exclusively use tidy tots diapers one size system in cloth diaper lingo it is a ai2 system my child is now 4 months old and we have been using these since about 2 months old and 11 pounds previously we used 1 booster during the daytime diaper changes and 2 boosters for nighttime however as our baby has grown and become a heavier wetter we are now using 2 boosters per diaper change during the day and so far 2 boosters continue to work for her nighttime diaper we couldn t be happier choosing this system and this company the company offers personal and exceptional customer service should you ever have any questions or concerns plus these hold up and wash really well with a quick dry time additional benefit is that they remain trim even with using 2 boosters my baby doesn t need to wear a larger size pant so all those super cute 0 3 3 6 month size clothes i received at my baby shower are getting used 4 stars only because they are a little pricy especially when having to use 2 boosters each diaper change 
5 5 this was a great addition to the care package i am putting together for a family member who is expecting this mirror will be perfect for traveling with baby 
5 5 this was my second ergo the first one lasted daily use for about 3 years with two different kids i wouldn t even take it off while driving and i think the seatbelt rubbing on it shortened its life i had taken the kid out while driving so i bought this one 3 years ago and we are still going on kid number 3 it is life changing i tried a sling and it just didn t work for me but this does i got the infant insert and used it when they were little and then moved up to using it without the insert and then on the back too i love it 
5 5 good
5 3 it has a hard time picking up the crying of my infant 
5 5 i like it
5 5 great 
5 5 this was for my grandson and it was absolutely the hit of his christmas gifts absolutely adorable soft and cuddly so glad i ordered it 
4 4 i love the product it works well exactly as described my only issue because i am super picky was that when it was finished being put together not that difficult fyi it seemed to be a little non symmetrical i expected it to be but it seems like i didn t put something together right double even triple checked myself and to my surprise it is just how it looks the instructions were not difficult at all went together rather easily just seems like the poles are a little bent or something it hasn t effected the use or any of the features so i just try not to stare at it super soft material easy to clean multi functional overall a great product you never know if a baby is going to want to be swung bounced or left alone maybe with vibration on so this product is nice for anyone who wants to be prepared for all of them 
5 5 i love these bottles i wish i had tried them with my first baby but there is no going back now the only thing that drives me crazy is they don t sell the bottles with nipples for 3 or 6 so when i bought this set it came with newborn 1 nipples so i had to throw them out and go to the store and buy new nipples just seemed like it was a waste that i had to go buy a different size because they don t sell them already with the size you need 
5 5 i love the lamp shade but i was expecting the whole lamp my fault for not reading the description right
5 5 my granddaughter loves mickey mouse so this was the perfect size table and chair set for her 
5 4 highly recommended a bit pricey but legit good design 
5 5 my 6 month old ate her first solid food with these spoons and had no issues eating the whole serving of food she also liked to chew on the spoon and tried to hold it herself 
5 2 none available 
5 5 excellent
5 5 my son loves his pillow very soft and perfect size it s his first pillow so we re very pleased great quality hasn t even stained from toddler drool 
5 2 first time mom with limited space bought this with the idea that it would help both save space and keep baby happy was very wrong with regards to the latter barely swings my 9 lb baby unless on highest setting with constant starts and stops motor is super loud you can barely feel vibration setting and music is too quiet going to take to grandma s house as a back up and have to invest in another swing 
5 5 this is so cute
1 1 this thing sucks i can t believe it has any stars at all it falls over with no toys on it stupid me for not reading reviews 
5 5 the little i got this for loved it 
5 3 i don t like that you need 2 hands to unlock thus gate we made it work by not fully locking it so you can get through one handed i e while carrying the baby but he figured out how to open it himself before i was ready for that it is one of the few really wide gates i found 
5 5 this has been a great bag for us the colors are neutral and not too girly or too manly the compartments are varied and useful it has held up pretty well for the past year that we have used it we love it 
5 5 super super super no issues
5 5 perfect daugher in law likes these to keep the different baby sizes separate 
5 5 we love these and have a couple of them if baby drops the pacifier it doesn t go bouncing across the room also these are harder to drop as they just kind of stay in place better than a lone paci my two month old can almost wrap his arm around the reindeer and keep the paci in place or if it pops out he can work it back in because it stays near i wasn t really sold on these until i used them now they are a must have 
5 5 thank you 
5 5 love these for our twin girls they only will use these and no others 
5 5 smells like vanilla my son loved this thing for weeks 
5 5 baby liked this brand best glow in the dark would help us both find them in his crib at night 
1 1 didn t work accurately of by several degrees even if taken over and over returned 
5 2 very small nipple size get the next size up 
5 5 very cute and excellent quality although my son never used it he never took to a dummy pacifier 
5 5 the only pacifiers my son ever liked the same as the one he got from lucille packard children s hospital 
5 5 my son loves his wubbanub so much i had to share with others and purchased this one for a gift i ve noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night 
5 5 item arrived on time and product quality was great 
5 5 these have been necessary for our baby love them 
5 5 great price and fast shipping
5 5 i refused to use pacifiers with my oldest she quickly found her thumb and i have had a hard time breaking her of the habit when my next baby was born i turned to pacifiers to alleviate thumb sucking and the damage is does to the mouth and teeth these are the only pacifiers we have used i am constantly ordering to replace ones that are lost 
3 3 i am not sure what happened on this order exactly ordered the 6 18 months pacifier i have others that are for that age range mostly mam so it may be a brand difference but the nipple was much smaller and my two year old had difficulty holding suction 
5 4 the description is precise and i got exactly what i wanted 
5 1 pacifier is made of really hard material 
5 5 while she can t talk yet it the type she ll use
5 5 baby made it his favorite 
5 5 really cute gift idea for baby shower to put on top of gift 
5 5 good gift item
5 5 so cute
5 5 best pacifier ever my son finally slept through the night with this pacifier and i tried a lot of pacifiers the glow in the dark are a must have for bed time he can find his pacifier in the dark and can reinsert it without me having to get out of bed its also great when you have to go in for the dream feed to find them without turing on the light 
4 5 cute wish my baby would take it though 
5 5 perfect
4 4 i tried almost every pacifier on the market i wanted my lo to use the nattursutten pacifier because it s made of all natural rubber and is one piece no space or hole for bacterial growth but even though i purchased the butterfly shape it was so big that it covered my lo s nose and my lo is quite large for his age so it wasn t because of his size other moms complain about the same design flaw too my second choice was the gumdrop pacifier because although it isn t made of the same high quality material as the nattursutten it was one piece so again no holes for bacteria to grow in but the pacifier was so heavy that my lo couldn t keep it in his mouth and i didn t want my lo to have to use so much force when using a binky just logically speaking i would think the lo s jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long so then i tried advent and dr brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils i ended up using mams pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn t obstruct my lo s breathing at all but they are a pain to clean the part that the lo sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there after awhile it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing as soon as my lo was older i again tried the nattersutten still same problem covered his entire nose back to gumdrop and thank goodness this time my lo was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try i m still not 100 satisfied with it because i don t understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow makes cleaning a pain oh and the design makes lo look like hannibal lecter it s a bit disturbing to me haha but for now my concern about bacteria growth in the mams binkies outweighs these issues until nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area i recommend the gumdrop version 
5 5 perfect
5 4 got it for my one and a half year old nephew good quality and recommended
5 5 perfect
5 5 quite reliable and easy to operate no problems so far i like the minimal set of features without the lullabies temperature b l very nice it has wall mounting option 
5 5 well designed 
5 4 inexpensive and lightweight 
5 4 i think this is a great monitor for the price we used to have a summer video monitor that worked well but wore out and the volume was always a bit static y this is so clear i also love how convenient the monitor is 
5 5 these are so great you can see the face of your rear facing infant and make sure they are ok with just one glance i would definitely buy it again 
5 5 a very pretty floppy hat perfect
5 5 i bought this for my daughter son in law they love it however there was no manual or any instructions included in the box which is kind of a pain as now we have to track them down online print them so we know how to set it up fold it up 
5 5 grand son said no no pee
5 5 i love how tall the head part raises 
5 5 item was as described and i am extremely happy that the item was received on or before the promised day 
5 4 wish these things came with splash guards
4 3 the fist few times we used these they worked great however after washing 2 3 by hand the suction stopped working they aren t good for the microwave so we just use them for cold stuff and hold the bowls ourselves also i wish there were lids for at least one of the bigger bowls but it s just the smallest one overall it s an o k product 
5 3 kind of small and a little chintzy for the price i expected a plush oversized bib it was not
4 4 this is a great baby monitor the only thing is we seem to be getting some feedback or interference when my husband or i walk near the receiver if either of us are wearing a jawbone up pedometer bracelet other than that it seems to work great 
5 5 one of my granddaughters theme is ladybugs i purchased this night light for use in her nursery mom and dad haven t used it yet i really like the light it is a bit larger than i expected if you look at the posted photo you can see the size as compared to the plate on the plug 
5 5 awesome thank you
5 5 best sippy cups we have used yet they do not leak unless shaken upside down like a salt shaker they have a rubbery nozzle that toddlers infants tend to like it holds a lot but is manageable enough to control for a little one i would definitely buy again 
5 5 great
5 3 after having 2 boys who always drenched their nighttime diapers i decided to try these out for added absorption but unfortunately my 2yr boy still wakes up with and overflowed diaper and booster pad i suppose i have to continue washing sheets everyday until he is ready for potty training 
5 5 this is a really good cover for the price would recommend this on an older baby hook and loop has remained sticky for five months and there have been no leaks with this cover 
5 5 so far we love it it looks just like the picture it took me over an hour maybe closer to 2 to assemble with a drill feels pretty study 
5 5 washes well i hung it to dry to prevent shrinkage 
5 4 good for the price we use this as an extra whenwe have llittle guests over or we are traveling w our little one lightweight and easy to put together 
5 5 the temperature thermometer reader on this was so helpful when baby was an infant great idea 
5 5 we have 2 kids and live in small 2 bedroom condo and space is very limited the primary reason i bought this tub is because it folds up and can hang in the shower when not in use it works perfect for us for this reason the tub is much larger than i expected it to be but i can tell it will work for a long while with our growing baby we bathed our 1 week old in the tub with a foam sponge insert that i bought at babies r us for 8 and it worked great i was able to angle the tub by pushing one side completely down and leaving the other side slightly folded i would recommend this tub but if you are going to buy it i would buy it from walmart com it is significantly cheaper there i think 34 and if you have it shipped to the store shipping is free 
5 5 looks awesome
5 5 my daughter has been using this as a baby bag for her daughter for almost a year it is sturdy and has heck of a lot of pockets and room i get lost using it every time too many pockets for my 49 year old brain this bag has come on road trips and grocery store trips to the babysitters and thrown in the back of the car it has stood up to our abuse so far :)
5 5 this crib is great quality and i like the dark cherry color we made sure to order the conversion kits so that we have them for the future i also found that this glider chair has cherry wood that matches the bed which was convenient http www amazon com gp product b00l40sgqa ref oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01 ie utf8 psc 1we also purchased this dresser which matches perfectly and is also good quality http www amazon com gp product b0069209fy ref oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 ie utf8 psc 1
5 4 this is a great transitionary sippy cup however parent who are weaning their little ones from the pacifier must beware this product has a good chance of replacing the feeling of the pacifier for your baby 
5 5 love this stroller the best part about it is that it is a side by side that fits through doorways it is very lightweight for a double and is super easy to fold and stow when 2 kiddos are in the weight is well distributed underneath you and it wheels around very nicely i know there are many other strollers out there that cost way more and may have more advantages but this is really all you need and it is a great price 
5 3 cushions aren t that comfy and the buckles are terrible to unbuckle it does the job though and my daughter can sleep fine without her head falling forward very easy to install and uninstall 
5 2 if given the choice i d probably go with a different unit while the bells and whistles are really cool when they work the price is probably not worth your hassle we are on our third unit since the first two have failed the first one stopped connecting entirely and in the second the charging housing on the unit has come lose to their credit withings has great customer service and despite this being a gift hence no proof of purchase they ve replaced our unit twice now 
5 5 son loved this great colors
5 5 amazing my son was potty trained but wouldn t use a toilet just his little potties we took this thing everywhere now we just keep it in the car for emergencies 
5 5 easy to clean lightweight doesn t get too dirty recommended 
5 4 my daughter uses this to hang her collection of sock monkey stuffed animals in her room she ran out of room to keep them on her bed and this keeps them off the floor and out of the way 
5 5 these diapers are super cute they started fitting my baby when he was about 9 lbs and the patterns are just stinking adorable they re very soft to the touch i love that they have all snaps and no velcro they re a good start to a cloth diaper collection these sometimes leak around the leg seams but it may be an issue of my son s shape i m not certain yet we ll see as he gets bigger for now i recommend them 
4 4 very useful to put all the items on the back of the car seat it only works if you have a head rest set type car seat 
5 4 great easy to fold space saving ball pit seems to hold up pretty well to an active toddler 
5 5 it did it s job kept my grandson busy
5 4 my granddaughter loves this
5 5 perfect size and thickness for my toddler he s not used to sleeping on a pillow yet up to this point he s been just resting his head flat on the mattress however as soon as he gets the hang of pillow sleeping i m sure he ll love it 
5 5 helps me keep my milk organized in the fridge great idea 
5 4 this has been a life saver for us wish it was less expencive though 
5 5 great
5 5 fits nice washes well and soft for baby 
5 5 omg i love these inserts they are so soft they work as an insert or a liner either way they are great love them 
3 5 well made should be longer 
5 5 i bought this pack n play to keep at my house for my grandbabies i love the diaper changing table it comes off very easily it doesn t fold over like most pack n plays that is a nice feature 
5 5 prepare for the upcoming birth of my baby
5 5 this gate has held up well with almost one year of heavy use the gate is easy to open and doesn t rip off the wall like the other gate we have i highly recommend this high quality gate 
1 1 it works but compared to the other bottles available out there the material is flimsy and the design is cheap and good luck cleaning those tubes after each feeding i use it once in a blue moon when we go on a long car ride lo is screaming for a bottle and we are unable to stop and feed him not worth purchasing 
5 4 these were a bit tough to install but only because my cabints are made of hard wood must drill a pilot hole and it is much easier they work as described and do the job
5 5 worked as promised mom n baby are very happy with this 
5 5 i love these things have one for each of my two a 10 month old and a 2 5 year old it hides the extra floor food until sweeping time food unsticks more easily and it keeps stuff from getting tracked all over and ground in also protects the rug under my table which isn t a huge deal because you a can t see most of the rug due to splat mat presence and b it s a cheap rug anyway but it looks much better without tons of blueberry banana and avocado smeared into it i really like these 
4 2 way smaller than i thought company did replace the first item that broke but was hoping to use at the park for my daughter to be able to move around and play in this is not for that 
5 4 great sturdy laundry basket
5 5 excelente producto
5 5 perfect
1 1 broke within a week of purchase 
5 4 what i needed and shipped on time but wish price was less for such a simple item 
5 5 a must have
5 5 great thank you 
5 3 purchased this thinking it would have elastic around the bottom like a regular fitted sheet to fit around a mattress so i could use it on a mattress made for the pack n play instead of just the padded hard board the pack n play comes with but it has square corners with no elastic just sewn like an envelope with no give at all if this was described somewhere i missed it unfortunately glad i only bought one instead of 2 like i was planning if you re using it for the board the pack n play comes with then it s perfect i have since purchased garanimals brand pack n play sized sheets that are fitted and work much better and they were 2 for the same price as this one graco sheet 
5 5 just as advertised 
3 4 i thought these were regular washcloths as it is not stated otherwise however be warned these are baby washcloths 
5 5 it keeps my grandson busy for a long time 
2 2 this product does serve the purpose it s intended to serve but having a growing 9 month old whose curiosity grew with her our baby was able to pull this product off very easily i blame this on the adhesive not being strong enough but at the same time if it were stronger it might damage the furniture so i ll pick my battles and just say that i wouldn t recommend this product for not being strong enough to stand up to a baby s natural desire to explore with their hands 
5 5 very clear picture 
5 5 i love these bottles i will be ordering more bigger ones when its time
5 5 perfect
5 5 great condition exactly what we wanted 
5 5 perfect
5 5 everything was perfect
5 4 cute small soft hopefully it holds up 
5 5 good
5 3 this is great for the baby because it helps keep pacifier in his mouth unfortunately my baby never took to this shape pacifiers and prefers the more classic style like the mam brand i wish you could attach the pacifier of your choice instead of having to use these i still give my baby to hold sometimes and he plays with it love the longhorn we live in texas so it s very fitting 
5 5 everything i expected soft to to the touch and it s now my daughter s favorite of her collection
5 5 awesome gift set was very happy with my purchase 
5 5 i love the design of these and wanted my baby to love them too but we have tried other pacifiers and he just won t take them guess our baby isn t a pacifier baby but that is okay because that is one less thing to wean him off of 
5 5 great binkie my 3 month old sucks it while grabbing the reindeer so cute easy to take out and wash too 
5 5 my little neice loves it and if she be happy so am i 
5 5 perfect
3 4 smaller than expected 
5 5 perfect for a little boy similar to the nuk pacifiers 6 18 month usually used by him so he took it with no problem that made me really happy because it is so funny 
5 5 some hospitals have gone 180 against formula and pacifiers this is what 2 years ago the hospital gave us after your daughter was born and it was a god send to soothe her i am all for breast feeding but the baby does not need to be on your nipple all the time give the a break and give the baby this 
5 5 great way to keep the paci around without constantly loosing it 
5 3 baby didn t like it i like that it s a whole piece made from silicon but the underside of the nipple is hollow so must be mindful to wash it thoroughly 
5 5 what can i say i don t know what i d do without these binkies we have about 10 of them because we are always losing them 
5 5 this is the only pacifier my daughter will use 
4 4 these are a great product they really work well for our baby only reason it has 4 stars instead of five is because it looks a little big for my daughters face but she is on the smaller side of her age range she will grow into it i m sure 
5 1 no inner packaging for item or labeling did not gift as intended as a result as parents likely will not accept a loose pacifier in a shipping package 
5 4 besides the soothie this is the only pacifier that our 2 month old likes easy to clean i sanitize in microwave in the medela bags that i use for breastpump and bottle parts 
5 5 i had one of these for my 18 month old and she loved it so upon the arrival of our new baby i just knew we had to have another one and now i can t leave home without it 
5 5 my nephew loves these he s started teething so we keep a glass of ice water nearby and dip it in every so often 
5 5 they really do glow in the dark very fun 
5 5 the glow in the dark feature is awesome especially at 3 in the morning when your searching for it
5 5 great paci our son has loved this since he was an infant we liked that he could find it if it fell out in the middle of the night only bad thing is that he s super attached to 34 monk 34 and will be a difficult habit to break :)
5 5 amazing product 
4 4 my baby won t take a pacifier thought for sure she d take this one since it s naturally shaped she spit it back out i m sure the quality is better than 4 stars but i ll never know i guess 
1 1 constantly fall out the babies mouth horrible design
5 5 my grand baby loves it
5 4 good
5 5 loved this fast shipping 
5 5 my son loves his wubb 
5 5 very satisfied 
5 5 don t know what it is about the wubbanubs but my baby niece won t take any other pacifiers this is the fifth one i buy for her the attached toys seem to enchant to the baby and the shape of the pacifier itself seems to perfectly fit her little mouth the toys can be detached after the baby stops using the pacifier so it s a good buy i definitely recommend 
5 4 cute pacifiers 
5 5 my son loved this fast shipping
5 5 perfect
5 5 very cute pacifiers made a great stocking stuffier for my son 
5 5 awesome
5 5 great fun gift for a shower 
5 5 have purchased two so far my nieces love them for their babies 
5 5 worked great created one for our new puppy and one for my 6 8 yr old daughters after reading the reviews about cracking i decided to place a damp paper towel on it as it began to dry it is drying perfect 
5 5 it is very sweet and cute and soft and it plays very well and it arrived in good time and in excellent condition the pull cord is made very well and if used properly will last forever 
4 4 we bought the mirror for the discount price of 1 99 i am glad it was only that much but just because there is nothing special enough to justify the price of 22 it s a large mirror we can see our daughter in it when we are driving but it s not attached very well to the headrest because it doesn t seem to be made for every head rest but in general it fit our needs 
5 5 this was a last minute impulse buy before our baby was born we wanted something to put the baby in that would allow him to stay in the same room as us if needed we never imagined how much we d depend on it taking it with us whenever we travel somewhere with the baby and he sleeps better in it than his crib right now so he gets to rest in it when he s having a rough night we ve used it for two months now with no issues 
1 1 this is not a rattle quality is poor the warning link says 34 not for children under 3 years 34 but is targeted to infants do yourself a favor sew bells or other noise makers to your child s socks 
5 5 love these bibs the colors and patterns are great and i love that there are two snaps so they will continue to fit as my boy grows the backing is super soft too i also like the longer narrower look as opposed to the short wide ones just more fashionable i think great for babies of all ages 
5 5 our baby is doing great with her new amber necklace she has gone from being miserable and making us miserable too to being her happy self again thanks for offering this great product 
5 5 thank you
4 3 it s a nice piece warm and easy to use however be aware 1 if you do not use a car seat base and need to put a seatbelt through it it becomes a bit of a hassle the cozy cover tends to pop off the when threading the seatbelt regular bundle me works better for that 2 if it s a graco carseat snapped into a graco snap n go you can t get the cover on while the seat is snapped in has to be taken out first3 with a newborn the baby s head sits lower than the opening and you need to open the zippers the zipper corners may poke the baby s eyes they should have made the zippers curve outwards not inwards4 safety alert with other kids in the backseat it s too easy for them to put the flap down covering the baby s face altogether
5 5 i love these we do blw and they are perfect for my 7 month old to start with self feeding i give applesauce on the blue one and yogurt on the orange one they work so much better for begginers than regular spoons i have actually purchased two sets they do discolor slightly but that is not a big deal 
5 5 love this product it fits perfectly with my medela pump parts so i can pump directly into the avent natural bottles the only bottles my daughter will take no leakage i ve only used it with the sealing ring though and for those of you with a hygeia pump you can use the medela flange ect and just use the hygeia tubes and use this product as well 
5 5 the recipient of these was very happy with them she is breast feeding and feels these work much better than the ones more easily accessible in general stores like walmart cvs target 
5 5 use it to keep cats in back bedroom area when necessary works much better than the narrower ones i tried before which they were able to open 
3 2 plays 1 line of twelve songs not 12 songs works and my two month old doesn t care but the parents find it a little annoying 
5 5 my 3 month old son loves this mobile i only purchased it from the reviews and everyone was right entertains him for 30 mins while i get the eight zillion other things done that need tending to around the house it s 100 worth the money 
5 5 so cute my little girl like it so much 
5 5 it s an awesome car seat i like how sturdy this seat is the only thing i don t like is its easy to open top buckle for a toddler but on flip slide easy for me too
1 2 this monitor works great when its working we dealt with frequent 34 out of range 34 error messages that appear for seemingly no reason at all it would be working fine and then all of a sudden is 34 out of range 34 then one day after about 5 months we went to turn on the monitor and there was no picture sound worked but shortly thereafter the sound stopped working as well we had to go out and buy a completely new monitor and our parents who bought this for us as a baby shower gift are trying to get their money back word to the wise if you have an american express card then purchase this monitor with that because amex will give you your money back if the product stops working 
5 5 great product
5 5 excelente 
5 5 my son have love these since he was born 
5 5 perfect 
5 5 i got this for my grandson to play with while i feed him he loves it it figured out how to make it spin around happy with my purchase 
5 5 safe way to travel
5 4 i am a long time babywearer and babywearing educator for its intended purpose the infant insert works pretty well it lets you wear very small babies in an ergo safely getting them high enough so airways are not constricted and they are not slumped however the insert is also pretty hot and bulky personally i prefer to use other carriers for very small babies stretchy wraps woven wraps or ring slings so that no insert modification is needed if you do have an ergo and no infant insert or prefer not to use one you can also roll up a receiving blanket at the bottom of the ergo to boost baby up high enough so they aren t swallowed by the carrier there are lots of youtube videos demonstrating this so it does work and is a fine product but personally i prefer other carrying options for babies small enough to need an infant insert 
5 3 the straws work great but break very easily 
5 5 got this for the parents to keep an eye on baby this unit allows you to visualize and or audio 
5 4 good
5 5 good
4 4 great little fans noticeable and refreshing little breeze for those hot summer walks or in our case hot vacation destinations little one grabbed at it repeatedly and still intact even running it didn t hurt him when he grabbed it which is great only gave it 4 stars because my 6 year old s hair actually got stuck and wound around the fan pretty tight seems like a product for kids should have some sort of shut off when something is stuck in it maybe for the price point its not available she wasn t hurt and since we were right there we were able to get her detached relatively easily would buy again 
5 5 bought this for my newest grandbaby momma he s now 4 months and he really enjoys his play time he rolled over and discovered the mirror such a precious smile came
5 5 i love the symphony pump and this was much less than purchasing with the rental i m a nicu mom 12 weeks pumping and not nursing so this was the best pump out there 
5 5 very good product and goo price 
1 1 waste of money if you do not have a tile shower do not get this this fell several times one of them almost hitting my 2 year old in the bath tub 
5 5 my 6 month old loves to look in mirrors and even though we have a back seat mirror i bought this one as a toy mirror for inside the house it s great quality and the mirror reflection is amazing not hazy or scratchy at all if i ever did want to put this in my car then i believe it would install very easily 
4 4 i m a size 36dd in bra and a medium in regular tops i ordered a large and it was a little big i could have just purchased the medium and used the extender if i needed it also the tag on the back is upside down it throws me off a little when i put it on but it s not really a big deal 
5 4 the quality of this plastic is very good the artwork on these are really cute the snap is good i just find the size to be too big and hard to pack for a child to bring to school the dividers do not reach the top of the lid so the contents may shuffle especially under the care of a child i d love these as a smaller singular box 
2 4 child easily rips them apart
5 5 it is so good that i actually bought two i kept one at bedroom and another one in living good product serves the purpose pretty well 
5 3 too small for a young toddler
4 4 this is a great product my son loved it the lights and sounds are awesome not to mention all of the jumping action its very colorful it was very easy to assemble i took less than a 1 2 hr it folds flat for easy out of the way storage which is a plus i would recommend this for parents who cannot seem to keep their babies distracted long enough to get a few things done around the house my only disappointment would be that it cannot be taken apart without destroying it once you snap the pieces together thats it you will not be able to un assemble it that is the only reason i gave it four stars i received this jumperoo free from fisher price through buzz agent to try and review and this is absolutely my own opinion of the product 
5 5 the owl and its baby were a big hit with my grand niece it turned out to be the perfect gift 
4 4 great because i can use my non britax car seat with the stroller the only downside is the car seat has gotten tougher to remove over time and sometimes sticks in the frame
5 5 these are awesome so light and soft great for babies toddlers in warmer weather 
5 5 this wrap is amazing this is my third baby and nothing compares to the quality and convenience of this wrap the fabric is sooo soft and it took me no time at all to figure out how to wrap my baby in it properly i ve been using it for two months and am considering getting another because i love it so much you won t regret buying it 
5 5 great grand baby saws thanks saves mommy messes
5 5 love these bottles my daughter is 2 months old and will drink from them without any problems she is just starting to outgrow the stage 1 nipples so will be purchasing the stage 2 ones soon i have the stage 2 classic but i like the naturals better because i think it s easier to switch from breastfeeding to bottle because of how the nipple is shaped they promote breastfeeding and have anti colic anti gas function as well 
5 5 so much fun 
5 3 ok in a pinch tends to swing either too fast or not at all 
4 4 good size as it covers our huge britax pinnacle car seat it has been on about 7 flights including international and it s still holding up however i think it may only have 1 or 2 international flights before it needs to be replaced as there are some spots starting to show wear overall not bad at all considering the price also nice and easy to pack when not in use 
1 3 do not be deceived this is just a big nightlight 
4 4 i m trying to find a sippy to replace my daughters bottles and heard these were great i agree it is pretty good and my daughter takes it the same as if it were a bottle but the only thing i have a problem is when she s drinking the nipple part sucks in and makes it hard for her to get the milk out i have to physically unscrew the lid to allow air back in to stop the problem other than that is is a good transition to a sippy cup 
5 5 great product thanks 
1 3 photo didn t express letters on ducks that was disappointing
4 5 exactly what we were looking for we have a big hallway but wanted to be able to keep the dog out of certain areas only complaint is the instruction to install where little hard to follow 
5 5 these are super soft and unnoticed i m a first time mom so breast feeding was a whole new ball game i love these definitely recommend hold up great in the wash machine 
5 5 excellent
5 5 perfect compact gate to keep my dog securely in my kitchen 
5 5 very practical and durable
5 5 this set of crib bedding makes a fabulous gift presentation for baby showers and parents to be though i was provided a sample for my own use when it arrived i felt like i was unwrapping a present it is encased in a simple clear square bag and the blanket is wrapped around a box with the other items folded within a second box the book sits in a little pocket so it is visible from the exterior of the case and makes it look that much more like a full gift set the screenprinted comforter is like a miniature quilt and i really love the bold beautiful design of the african dream one the comforter is extremely comfortable and was almost immediately co opted by my cat however once we extracted the cat my toddler loved it too he snuggled down and had no trouble falling asleep on it i like that the crib sheet and the crib skirt go so well together yet the colors of both are neutral enough to where they go with the other cream pale tan and gray sheets that i already own the stuffed animal is more like a pillow than it is something to snuggle with or it can make a great decorative accent on a shelf nearby most of the sets that i have found in local stores have a disney theme or some other tacky appearance that i would not dream of purchasing for somebody else as a gift these by contrast make such a strong presentation that i would absolutely feel confident getting any of these sets as a baby shower gift 
3 3 loose fitting and not quite as warm as i imagined but cute and soft
5 5 compatible with our bottles and wash well
1 1 not very useful
5 3 ok to buy
5 5 i bought these for a close friend she said she was very happy with them they were very useful and durable i will ne buying some again for my nursing days in the future 
3 3 pretty it fits but the umbrella circumference is very small disappointed woukd only be effective to cover the car seat not a child in the stroller that s forward facing 
5 5 very good customer service there are believers and non believers that this works i think it s what you think will help your child teething is a very uncomfortable period i m willing to try this if it helps even a little bit 
3 4 it s not as beautiful as the pictures but it s ok for my son 
5 5 more fun than anything if you re cutting one banana is it worth it probably not if you re cutting several bananas absolutely just rinse it off immediately after using before the fruit residue has a chance to dry and it should last a long time 
5 2 i suppose the necklace is pretty cute but this is the new alchemy sure baltic amber is a mild analgesic but there s no reliable evidence to suggest that it can be absorbed through the skin in such a way as to have any impact on teething pain if you enjoy reading tea leaves have at it 
5 5 got this for my friend in seattle as christmas gift she likes the design color warm feeling and quality very happy with the purchase it seems to be a great gift idea in this holiday season 
5 5 love these bibs colors are bright and 2 year old loves both colors attachment works well and is easy to fasten with one hand really good product big pocket works well and all is easy to clean under tap very satisfied 
4 4 very nice but wish i had chosen the bigger size 
5 5 i love this wall decal in my daughter s room it looks so absolutely adorable and it sticks to the wall very well we actually just went through a move and with smart packing this decal was easy to re stick to a new wall my daughters room was boring and white but we lived in a rental so i could not do anything permanent to the walls after sticking this decal on the wall my daughter s room had life i was so impressed with the difference it made and i got tons of compliments from other mothers wondering where i got it i would recommend this product to anyone who wants their child s room to look like an adorable enchanted forest 
5 5 excellent
1 1 does not meet the standard that was describe during the purchase highly disappointed 
4 4 i bought these for my microwave after my daughter had and accident while trying to open the microwave they work pretty well although they are a little larger than i would have liked 
5 5 exactly what the original package came with our son got a hold of it too many times and knocked it off his crib so we needed a replacement for the one that broke picture and sound are great a great buy for us being new parents and having an infant down the hall 
5 5 these are perfect for our daughter i love that the handle glows in the dark 
5 2 doesn t stay latched and is flimsy i wouldn t trust this to keep an actual child safe i bought it to keep my old dog from going down stairs 
5 2 really disappointed we did a ton of research to find the best mattress our priorities were relatively high number of coils low stronger gauge for coils and for border rods this mattress supposedly has 204 coils 15 5 gauge with 6 gauge border wire and square corners our box came mangled the mattress twisted and with a s pronounced bulge running down length of infant side also the corner supports are not in the corners but in 3 inches very dangerous border wire imperceptible and the whole thing doesn t feel 34 firm 34 so much as 34 cushy 34 seems like this had a rough life before it got to us but we are not confident that a replacement would address the other strength defects 
3 3 these do the job but are pretty thin and aren t anything to write home about in the softness comfort department i m glad i have an extra sheet but i think i would have preferred to have gotten a padded sheet now that i see how this compares after having been washed 
5 5 i should have bought 10 
5 4 really cute baby cannot wear right now bought them large
5 5 just like the spouts that come with the cups 
5 2 does this camera have night vision mode even with the color monitor and does it have sound when the baby cries a god father who is looking for excellent quality for my god child 
5 4 excellent car seat cushioning was good and easy to install to car only disadvantage is there is room to wash the cloth in washing machine
5 5 really cute love it
5 3 somehow water still gets in her eyes every now and then no matter how careful i am still it is way easier than the ones that go completely on the child s head my toddler won t ever leave those on so it is still better for us than others we have tried 
5 5 i have been taking pictures every month it s so nice to see the monthy growth 
5 5 thank you
5 5 love this towel it has been used for years and is still as soft and useful as when we first got it 
5 5 lovingly ordered for my first granddaughter 
5 5 i love this diaper bag it fits a lot of stuff and looks cuter than most of the loud patterned bags out there i love all the little pockets and places to put stuff but i do need to be careful to remind myself regularly of what s in there because it s easy to forget a nice feature is the pacifier pouch on the side which i use regularly the straps to hook the bag onto a stroller are nice too overall very happy with my purchase 
5 5 my 2 year old loves these the shipping was somewhat slow 
5 5 i am obsessed with hello kitty and having a daughter tends to make me buy more things with hello kitty i love this activity cube and it will definitely keep her preoccupied when she gets bigger 
5 4 the warmer keeps the wipes warm as stated but it also creates condensation inside the warmer and on the top lid because of the condensation it s hard to see how much wipes are left even with the light on the cord that attaches to the adapter doesn t seem to have a strong connection though because i ve had it turn off on me a few times when the cord moved the wipes are warm when dispensed but keep in mind that it cools very fast 5 10 seconds max so you have to use it immediately i would definitely recommend it especially through the winter months since my dd startles when i use cold wipes 
3 4 not bad sealing can also but take a breath i do not know good
5 3 it doesn t hold a lot of liquid but it does do a nice job even after they are potty trained to keep the bottom of the car seats clean from them spilling drinks and food on themselves 
4 3 they do glow in the dark which is nice but it is a soft glow since it is a soft glow if the glowing portion of it is facing the crib mattress you still can t find the pacifier not worth purchasing if you want it because it glows 
5 5 fantastic all natural toothpaste my toddler loves it 
5 5 we purchased this thinking it would be great for our daughter as a first pillow the pillow is very clearly high quality and very soft but my daughter moves around a lot in her sleep so we found she kept rolling off the edge of the pillow because it is so poofy and she didn t stay still in her sleep long enough to get it broken in to make it less poofy i decided to steal it to use as a travel pillow for long car rides and on the airplane and i love it even if you find you can t use it for your child at night it still makes a great travel pillow and is worth the money we haven t had to wash it yet but it looks like it will be very easy to wash and keep clean when the time comes 
5 5  videoid 9754c0461ea0f5471aae69bdf21f5510 this video is a very quick look less than 2 minutes at this camera and its monitor i include an actual demo of its use in a dark room stepping outside and turning the lights off it works exactly as advertised the foscam fbm2307 is not meant to be a high end internet monitoring sd card recording remote controlled pan and tilt baby monitor it has none of those features by design there is no sd slot there is no usb slot by design if you want those features just look elsewhere but as an excellent stand alone baby monitor or cat monitor or front desk monitor this works fine i found the range to be outstanding i left it in my office and made it about 200 feet away and down the stairs before the monitor lost contact with the camera ymmv also the clarity of the video and sound monitoring gave me nothing to complain about this would be easy to throw in a bag or purse and take with you when you re travelling it comes with two individual power supplies for the camera which must be plugged in and the monitor which has a rechargeable battery and can be used remotely but can be used plugged in overall it has a nice solid feel i confess to being a fan of budget products which work well this is spot on in that category sample provided 
5 5 my daughter loves it this product is so great my baby loves biting on the monkey itself this also helps keeping the soother in her mouth when she is try to sleep i am ordering another one 
5 5 both of my children used wubbanub i love how easy it is to locate in the room by finding the plush toy when it gets dirty i throw it in the washing machine and then let it air dry after it is dry i clean and sanitize the pacifier in the bottle warmer i like to buy this pack of three to give out to all of my friends who are expecting it is the perfect gift 
5 4 oh look i can see my baby s bink bink when it falls out this product ensures that lazy fathers can indeed do something productive in the wee hours of the night with their small human child the only drawback occurs during that period when you first wake up from a dream and feel like you are staring into the glowing eye of a dragon or other such beast 
5 5 fits 2 soothie pacifiers perfectly at first my husband didn t like the extra bag but it truly does make finding a pacifer in a hurry easier and the fact that it snaps means we can quickly switch between bags 
5 4 love this product
5 5 i haven t actually used these pacifiers yet as my son is 8 months old but i m sure i ll be opening them up soon he loved the younger stage ones and has been using them a lot i like the feel and he enjoys playing with and moving them around i also like that these are pretty easy to clean and keep track of i received a package for review purposes 
5 4 cute 
5 5 this is incredibly adorable and very durable it says 0 6 months but it works fine for my 2 year old 
5 4 i really love the pacifier
2 5 the dogs liked it too :(
5 4 perfect for any detroit tiger fan or soon to be fan i purchased these for my best friends baby as a christmas gift they seem to be pretty standard pacifiers with just a super cool emblem on them very quick shipping especially w the holidays i placed my order less than ten days before christmas and not only did it arrive on time is was early i m satisfied with my purchase
5 5 this is the best nuggey anyone ever made my granddaughter is two and she won t suck on any other pacifier so i bought her 17 this christmas i wish you would come down in price but they are the best staten island new york lady rider
5 5 my daughter loves them we get compliments from everyone about them she will not use anything else i can leave one in her diaper bag one at home and one at grandma s we love wubbanub 
5 5 grandson carries it everywhere 
5 5 just what every baby of a dedicated buckeyed fan needs 
5 5 cute little bag love that it s made in the usa the waterproof material on the inside is of much better quality than any other waterproof style bag i ve had 
5 4 even though my son didn t really like a pacifier he loves to hold on to the animal part of the wubbanub and now even at 17w he chews on the soothie part and actually on the animals too i liked how the animal balanced the soothie for the newborn to keep it in their mouth awesome product makes a great gift 
5 3 very cute 
5 3 my son didn t like these one very much 
5 5 these are the best bottles ever easy to clean the bottom can be taken apart for deep clean this is a very nice set 
5 4 great product i love phillips avent products 
5 5 i have bought wubbanubs for my children my niece and friends everyone loves them 
5 5 good pacifiers 
5 4 i wasn t breast fed so i bought one of these for myself for my 40th birthday i had read good things about adults using pacifiers for anxiety and since i have self esteem issues which are easily fixed by envious stares from others i figured two birds one diamond pacifier since buying this diamond encrusted pacifier my life has completely changed i am no longer anxious and while in public sucking away on my bangin new sparkle thang i get a lot of looks i sense people and children and maybe even their pets staring at me while i m catwalking and glittering down the street on the subway in grocery stores and at chuck e cheese where i make it a point to show up all the toddlers have i made many bad choices in my life absolutely but getting a 17 000 diamond encrusted pacifier is not one of them i suck and sleep soundly at the shelter where i m now living since this purchase has set me back some and kim kardashian tweeted me back when i sent to her a picture of it yah i have been touched by celebrity and that has just added the entire cake to my diamond dusted icing one star off for the diamonds that keep falling out but i replace them with craft crystals from michaels and no one s the wiser 
5 5 it can fit two philips avent soothie pacifiers stacked nice big handle with one open end to bend and fit easily around anything purse handle baby links car seat handle 
5 5 love these the only orthodontic pass that doesn t get mold in it 
5 5 i love that they glow in the dark so they are easy to find in the crib at night 
1 1 we ve only had this monitor for a little over a year and the motor and the sound have now stopped working conveniently right after the one year warranty this monitor was expensive and i would not waste the money 
4 4 placed the order on thursday got it on saturday used it on sunday my daughter is 2 years 4 months and it was a good fit but was not able to wash very good on places near the ear but my daughter is still crying just because she is afraid that water will flow over expecting it to get better will update the review again after a few weeks i tried it on me and it was tight near my ears i am not sure if it is the same way for my daughter 
5 3 it s convenient works well used on recent vacation make sure to have back of seat reclined some to have it close
5 5 excelente
5 5 wonderfully
5 5 hilarious 
5 4 super smooth this thing is better than the stroller system we had for a our first child which probably cost us twice as much very easy to assemble and use maneuvers very well even in tight spaces my only complaint is that it is hard to put things underneath when the car seat is actually attached 
5 5 this is a great idea but a litttle too big for my 2 year old
5 5 gift to son swift they use it 
5 5 i bought this as a gift on the registry the recipient had used one in a previous pregnancy and was looking forward to using this again she said it was very durable and held everything easily the backpack idea kept her hands free so she could deal with her little one 
5 5 so cute
1 2 this is not one handed unless my husband and i are missing something very obvious it also makes a loud noise while it s retracting which calls attention if you are tying to silently sneak away i would not recommend this for anywhere there is a sleeping baby 
5 5 this is a really cute pacifier for a baby boy the nipple is securely sewn to the stuffed animal and doesn t fall off stuffed animal is soft and squishy so baby loves to hug and squeeze nipple is comparable to soothies 34 newborn 34 pacifier in regards to firmness 
5 5 great 
5 5 adorable i first heard about these on a youtube when watching videos on baby essentials for my unborn niece nephew i couldn t resist the reindeer he s adorable i love the fact that young babies can easily put this back in their mouths if they lose it during the night i hope baby likes it when it arrives 
5 5 great
4 1 pacifier is stuck to the stuffed animal makes sanitation a little harder
5 5 newborns love these i got them for my niece here in korea and she is obsessed 
5 5 adorable i first heard about these on a youtube when watching videos on baby essentials for my unborn niece nephew i love the fact that young babies can easily put this back in their mouths if they lose it during the night i hope baby likes it when it arrives 
5 5 love it 
5 5 best item ive ever bought for my baby she cant live without it super soft and stays on her chest when the paci slips out of her mouth 
3 2 didn t really help us with keeping the pacifier in maybe would work better with a younger baby we started using at about 3 months old the item is cute though and as described 
5 5 best investment ever my son loves his monkey and it holds up great does great in the washer i have 3 of them for him so we can interchange them love that we never lose it and that it allows my son to manipulate it to sooth himself highly recommend 
5 5 these are my son s favorite pacifiers he is 2 now and this is the brand he has liked since he was a newborn they re really cute and they hold up to boiling well if only we could keep from loosing them 
5 5 these are wonderful 
5 5 these are the only pacifier my breastfed baby would take 
4 5 haven t used it but cute as a button 
3 5 i was a bit skeptical about this product early on in baby s life as it seemed hard for her to keep it in her mouth not to mention she preferred the nuk brand more however i became a convert around the five month mark when i started putting baby to sleep with this guy in her crib and found that she was able to find the pacifier when it fell out thanks to the critter attached i even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well even though my daughter is now almost eight months we still use these as her night time pacifiers for the reason above not to mention i think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth another idea i read about in a magazine is to cut the pacifier off when you are trying to wean baby this still allows them to have something familiar and cozy but the paci is gone food for thought 
5 5 love these pacifiers the nipple is so sturdy and my daughter loves it 
5 4 do not buy the gift set go for the separate bottles the gift set has a different inferior bottom seal and it leaks it doesn t matter how dry the bottle parts are the regular bottles that are sold in pairs are excellent and have revolutionized feeding for us highly recommend overall 
5 4 my daughter has had her wubbanub for almost a year now and it has proven it s worth a thousand times over only issue with it is you can t remove the pacifier com the dog to clean so i have to hand wash the dog and all and it takes all day to dry making that the longest day in the world for my kiddo still i would get one for anyone expecting a baby 
3 1 loved the product for my son however just bought a two pack of them to add to his pacifier collection and the box was empty very annoyed 
5 5 my baby s favorite pacifiers since he was a newborn great fit and like that is comes with 4 because all pacifiers are easy to lose 
5 5 this is the cutest pacifier it is well made and adorable 
5 3 these were not as pliable as the pacifiers that my infant son had been using prior to the purchase he s 5 months old and doesn t like using them 
4 2 same as other 1 star reviews i got the purple and pink ones for my son 
5 5 exactly what i was looking for i wanted to match the pacifier that was given to us in the hospital as the nipple was similar to the nipple shield we were using as well trying to avoid any nipple confusion these were exactly the same as the pacifiers we received in the hospital 
5 5 really cute and good quality 
5 4 good pacifer 
5 5 this is one of the pacifiers we got in the hospital with my first son after buying all dr browns pacifiers he would not take anything else except for nuks we couldn t find them in store except on amazon the same exact thing happened with my second son we will never buy a different brand 
5 5 well made item is so cute 
5 5 worth every penny we also have the formula pro great timesaver 
5 5 these wubbanub pacifiers are hands down my favorite the little animal on the end is cute and soft and makes finding the pacifier easy in low light it also makes it easy for the child to find too i highly recommend 
5 5 thanks
5 5 they are pacifiers and they worked as pacifiers :)
5 5 these are the best pacifiers and everyone i know who uses them says their kids love them as well i get a kick out of watching them used by either way our daughter loved the little stuffed animal on the end also it helps make them a little larger which is nice since its easier to keep an eye on them i don t love the look of the rubber pacifier without the animal either 
5 5 my first daughter used nuk pacis but i had to buy a different brand for my new baby as per my pediatrician s recommendation so as not to confuse her these are great they fit well in his mouth he can hold it easily and the designs are cute 
1 1 i got these just for the fact that they glow in the dark and surprise they don t disappointed they are just regular pacifiers 
5 5 three 2 packs stronger than the newborn ones 
5 5 baby s favorite pacifier
5 5 this tiger is by far the softest wubbanub the hairs under the ears are a great texture for little hands the legs are larger than other ones we have had highly recommend 34 tigee 34 
5 4 much smaller than anticipated 
3 3 i don t know what the big deal is about these they were fine when i first popped them in my kiddo s mouth however my little one frequently twisted it to the side despite the curved fit and it would then block his nose i think the soothies are a much better design 
5 5 great paci holder you can fit two of any brand inside attaches well to your bag and great design 
5 5 this brand is the best pacifier in the whole entire world my child loves them and they are easy to keep up with since the puppy makes it such a large item it is wonderful 
1 2 novelty item baby hates it 
5 5 very good
4 3 was purchased as a gift and the baby seemed to choke on the nipple so they were not used may work well for another baby though 
5 5 chosen because they are all silicone but i keep getting more because they seem to be my son s favorites 
5 5 these have saved our sanity i bought these after they were recommended by a friend and i received a single pack at my baby shower i ve since purchased several because we are always losing them or dropping them and we must have one on hand for our little guy these are very soothing to him and not too big for his mouth he has been using them since he was 1 month old and is now almost 11 weeks still loves them they are cute and neutral blue and green could really be used for a boy or girl the best part is that they are orthodontic so they won t cause him any damage 
5 2 because the base of the pacifier is round i e there is no cut out for the baby s nose and quite thick it bashes the baby in the nose when she sucks which to put it mildly she hates 
5 5 i love it it was a great gift for my little one
5 2 i d seen these all over getting great reviews my son hates them they are extremely large and bulky compared to regular pacifiers it s very hard for him to keep it in as he has to suck so much harder due to the weight so he just spits it out 
5 5 excellent item 
5 3 these were not the same as pictured i got the green ones they are the best pacifiers but sad about the color 
5 5 excelent
5 5 these are wonderful i buy the glow in the dark ones for all my first time parent friends 
5 5 i get stopped by everone to laugh at my 9 month old it is clever and adorable 
5 5 she loves it
5 5 i bought this for a baby and got shot the next day it was perfect 
5 5 excelent
5 5 good product good delivery time fair price
5 5 my 3 month old loves this binky she cuddles the lamb while she sucks the binky i am so thankful for this product her daycare provide also loves this item as well because of how well it stays in place a must have for any new baby 
5 5 my daughter is in love with these she won t use any other type of pacifier she s only 3 months and we ve been using these since she was about 2 weeks also the handles glow in the dark which is super great for rolling over when she drops it and being able to see it in the dark 
5 5 so cute
4 4 so far good a bit cheap but good
5 5 this is my 7 week old baby s favorite pacifier he only likes these highly recommended 
5 4 love it cute durable and easy to clean stands up to the washer and dryer 
5 5 i honestly expected to get two binkies i got four so that was a pleasant surprise 
5 3 clear pacifiers are very difficult to find in the middle of the night 
5 4 grandpa and i will be able to find her binkie 
5 5 these are so awesome sadly it is my 3 year old who still uses one at nighttime 
5 5 took the baby a bit to adjust to this pacifier it s longer than most but very very soft he loves it now to help him sleep most nights 
5 5 met expectations it os so much easier to get an accurate temperature 
5 4 none available 
5 5 great for in the car so you can reach behind you and locate the pacifier if it falls out doubles as a toy for your baby too the only downside is you cannot wash or sterilize the pacifier 
5 5 quality binky
5 5 my 8 month old has refused pacifiers his whole life lately he has struggled to stay asleep at night i in a desperate attempt decided to try a pacifier again i bought the mam brand and he actually loved it and he slept all night long relief i m one happy mom thanks mam 
1 1 i ordered these in hope that they would help my newborn soothe themselves since i heard it was so highly rated however i beg to differ when i introduced him to the soothie my newborn had it in his mouth for maybe one second and it would keep flying out of his mouth horrible pacifiers they do not stay in the newborn s mouth definitely would not recommend anyone getting this especially if you wish to calm your wailing baby 
5 5 amazing
5 5 my baby loves these binkies she refused binkies as an infant until we discovered these the price on this 2 pack is lower than anywhere else i have seen 
5 5 favorite binky by far in fact our first one which our dogs loved also was so great that we ordered a second after it was defluffed by the dogs 
5 5 love the new wubbanub my 8 month old daughter loves the elephant since there are many places for her to grab and easily put back into her mouth 
5 5 loved it for my baby kept air out of his mouth 
5 5 nuk pacifiers are the best ever i have tried other brands and my girls only like these ones 
5 5 our son loves his wubbanuber he loves the soothie pacis so we had to try this not only is it cute but it s very useful it helps keep the pacifier near his mouth so when he s done sucking it doesn t fall to the floor to wash it i just use the pink bucket we left the hospital with and put a little soap and water and clean it by hand it holds up well my son spits up a lot so we have to wash it often it does say you can machine wash in a mesh bag but we haven t tried that yet i don t want it to fall apart and we are without his favorite nubber we will try after he gets his new one from santa i might update then 
5 5 good quality i like it 
5 5 our 2 month old has loved these pacifiers since birth we bought the 6 pack so we could have them in the diaper bag and around the house at all times super helpful 
5 4 tried several brands until we found these they are shorter than other brands and do not make the baby gag she would spit out or gag on other pacifiers so these are perfect for her only problem is that they leave a mark on her face around her mouth from it being short and the baby sucking hard 
5 5 so cute i gave it as part of a baby shower gift the new mom loved it 
5 5 first off these will only glow if you expose them to light for a while first same as any other glow in the dark product i love the mam pacifiers because my son showed strong favor to them when he was only a month old do yourself a favor and don t bother with novelty pacifiers with mustaches and funny sayings these fit perfectly in baby s mouth no matter how which direction it goes in once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths it s easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark it s easy to find in the crib at night i m not a fan of the clear ones because they re hard for him to find to the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool that s like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop babies drool it s a fact of life get over it also do yourself a favor and purchase the mam pacifier clips they re the only ones that work with mam pacifiers 
5 5 good
5 5 my son loves his wubbanubs we have the frog and the monkey and he has used them since he was only a few weeks old having the animal attached to the pacifier has really helped us keep track of the pacifier we haven t spent lots of money on lost binkies we get lots of compliments of this and it s a lot cheaper here on amazon than in the store 
5 5 works great easy to wedge in place near our baby so he can suck on it but soft and squishy enough it s not something he chokes on when he barfs 
5 5 a must have for babies 
5 5 perfect holder for on the go
5 5 our daughter loves these they have become her best friend 
5 5 excellent 
5 5 perfect
5 3 cute little pouch holds one clean soothie style pacifier but i don t know how you d clean it if you put a dirty one in i m tempted to go to a ziploc bag instead 
5 5 we love this product there is no better binkie than natural rubber our daughter actually lost her first one at the store and her heart was broken i ordered one online right away and got it in a couple days thank you 
5 3 great product my baby loves it we got this because every time she stopped sucking on the regular pacifiers they would fall on the floor this one just rest on her chest instead when she stops she is just under 4 months and has have two of these for about 2 months we feel that it has helped with her hand control the only reason i gave this product three stars is because our baby has been known to chew on the legs she doesn t have teeth yet and the other night one of the legs broke open and little beads came out lucky it was when i was holding it and she did not have it and did not swallow any we still love these but we squeeze the legs to check for loose stitching before giving them to her 
5 5 my husband went to ut so this was perfect 
5 5 these pacifiers are the best on the market especially when you re trying to find it in the dark or making sure it s still in your baby s mouth while out walking around after dark 
5 4 its cute safe but i wish we can replace and wash the nipple part easier 
5 5 best thing ever 
5 5 perfect
5 4 love these pacifiers 
5 5 our girl didn t like any pacifies we tried expert this one 
5 5 my daughter used these pacifiers until she was a year old she loved them i liked that they are all natural the only bummer was they are a bit expensive so i was a bit obsessed with not losing them we used a pacifier chain to keep tabs on it they also need to be replaced after a bit still my daughter loved them so i can t complain 
5 5 i love these the nipple part is the same size as the 0 3mo pacifiers but these ones are a lot thicker around the base and also the nipple is a lot tougher for their teething 
5 5 excelente
5 3 it was not exactly as i was waiting
5 3 my baby does not want pacifiers so this one sje won t accept anymore but the quality is great and love that it s just one piece
5 4 we love wubanubs so much the elephant design wasn t our favorite felt the ears are a little too big and block baby s view we also have the giraffe and love that one 
5 5 these are wonderful my baby loves them and they are beautiful i like the fact that they glow in dark and makes it easier to find in the crib at night time 
5 5 great quality 
5 1 my breastfed baby won t take these or other brands shaped like these he only accepts the avent pacifiers pop out of his mouth he can t suck on them 
5 5 my daughter loves these things 
1 1 this product appears to be a counterfeit i am so disappointed poor packaging and the lamb was actually dirty i found once opened how can i give this to a new baby 
5 5 love them
5 4 great product 
5 5 cute pacifiers and my grandson likes them
5 5 makes life so easy since these glow in the dark 
5 5 the paci s are perfect but i do wish i could pick the colors 
5 5 perfect for daddy s girl
5 5 these have really stepped up bed time with our little ones making it easier to find these things in the dark is also a big bonus the glow last at least an hour or two and even longer depending on how dark the room is every parent knows how hard it is to get kids to go to their room and go to bed now all we use are these glow in the dark pacis and our 1 5 year old son who only gets them at night is super excited to go to bed 
5 5 love them
5 5 so easy to wash wider base has helped to rid of nipple confusion which is a huge deal for breast feeding mommas 
5 5 my baby loves this thing he really really loves this thing thanks a lot 
5 5 this was the only paci my daughter used 
5 4 works as intended
1 1 what i received was totaly different from the picture also the product was put in an unencapsulated plastic bag very very very disappointed damn it 
5 5 was a baby shower gift she went crazy over this thing it was the one thing that she really wanted she was screeching when she saw it 
5 3 packaging in the clear box was not included this wubbanub came loose in a plastic bag not nice presentation for a baby gift product is great though babies can hold on also easy to clean 
1 2 i didn t like the vanilla scent to use for the baby the scent is pretty strong and i had to return unfortunately 
5 5 love these makes losing pacifiers so much harder finding them so much easier but when they are lost more expensive to replace 
4 4 the product is great however i missed that this pacifier only allows the infant to place it in the mouth one way so my son s pacifier is often upside down in his mouth whenever he tries to self soothe other avent pacifiers does not have this issue 
5 5 great product
5 5 gift recipient had this on her wish list which made it an easy buy product seems to be on a lot of mother s shower lists if they don t this would make an excellent choice if you re searching for ideas
1 2 doesn t stay on tile wall i almost fell twice z9now use it for holding back brushes etc don t trust it 
4 4 i have had this chair for over 8 months and so far its a good chair it does tend to squeak alot but some wd40 takes care of that i have noticed that i have to re tighten the fasteners as they come loose quite often 
5 5 my sweet baby cant get enough of this doll so soft
5 5 works great for my niece
5 5 i m so glad i have this i know i would lose much more sleep were it not for the reassurance of the snuza 
5 5 perfect for cute little faces 
1 1 i never write reviews but was so disappointed in this and what s more important when baby is sick than dependable readings started getting irratic readings within months low battery replaced the battery and still getting 95 7 on all the readings when my daughter had 100 fever do not buy this i m going to try a braun thermoscan my third thermometer and write the company to dee if i can be reimbursed :(
5 5 very satisfied with the height esthetics s and the availability to make this gate a permanent fixture if desired 
1 1 do not stick
5 5 they are for my son s new baby comiing in april so i can t really say how they like it but it looks like he will get great use of it because he lives in florida and baby doesn t need a sunburn when out with dad 
5 5 great condition 
5 4 i absolutely love these bottles and the fact that they transition from normal bottles to sippy cups but i ve been very frustrated that the company has apparently stopped selling the sippy cup tops my child was chewing through the tops and i desperately needed a replacement thankfully i discovered that the prince lionheart sippy tops and handles work perfectly on these bottles 
5 1 i use this as a wet bag i love the print thats why i bought it in the first place its a medium size will hold about 6 soiled diapers and 6 12 soiled inserts perfect for on the go i love the mesh zipper pouch in the front also so you can keep dry clean inserts in the same bag perfect for a large diaper bag upadte its been just a few weeks since i received and reviewed this product i have now had a 180 this bag has started to leak the waterproof inner has begun tearing at the seams small little slits all along the sides i wash it probably once a week since i do rotate between two wet bags with my diapers so really not that often i thought that it was a great buy until this issue started i would rather spend more for another kanga care bag sad because i do love the print and the wet and dry pockets :(
5 4 the sleepy head pillows are great i bought them for our 4 year old who waswaking up with bad allergies in the mornings switching pillows seems tohave helped thanks jennifer moore
5 4 exactly what i needed for public restrooms 
5 5 love how simple the pacifier is and how its wide plate allow us to put it on any surface and it won t tumble easily also it doesn t easily fall down from baby s mouth if he s lying flat and face facing up since the weight of the pacifier is just nice not too heavy not too lightweight simple design easily washed i boil it in hot water to wash my baby does not immediately suck the pacifier so we have to hold it between his lips first and then he ll take his time before he properly sucks the soothie 
5 5 these are fun 
5 5 works fine on the uppababy g luxe 
5 5 nice
5 5 great feel i have large fingers and when i finally look at my finished product after typing i m amazed at the jibberish i produced now with my new stylus i m saving time it feels great in your hand and you tap and not push like you would with the rubber tipped stylus thanks to joto i m now able to jot down what i mean instead of hope and wish i m accomplishing something 
5 5 good quality fits my one year old well and will grow with him snaps are great 
5 5 this blanket is so cute it s a mix of polyester silk satin and really soft it has little loops or 34 taggies 34 on the blanket that allow you to attach it to wherever you want the puppy wearing the santa hat is darling and will look so cute in pictures i bought this for my newborn nephew and i can t wait to see him cuddled up with it on christmas 
5 5 very sweet works great
5 4 works great 
5 5 my baby shaniqua loved looking like a hippo after her bath these robes are so fun and we had great customer service they accommodated every request that we had 
5 5 i use this to check on baby when i m at a stop light i can see her very clearly 
5 1 i bought babyplus about over 6 years agoi have both 2 year old and 5 year old here is the story i like to share too i used when i was pregnant with my 5 year old son following the instructions he is a very smart and sweet boy but he has been diagnosed as sensory integration order and behaved as add we have been struggled with 3 years now though things got so much improved he still has spd issue and is very sensitive to sounds he has development delay in term of maturity from 3 times visit in last few years all we know he is not a typical kid no matter how smart he is as parents we need invest much time and energy for the treatments for now each time he goes to concert he has to wear a headset to reduce the sound while for my 2 years old i didn t use that much as i always forgot i used after 24 weeks probably 3 times a week she is pretty normal so far compared to her brother interesting she never shows any problem to sound and she has much better attention span i don t know what is the cause of two kids but i definitely not suggest to use the device during pregnancy 
4 4 so this is basically a stylish color coded thermometer it gives me peace of mind as we live in an apartment that has constantly shifting temperatures the thermometer seems to want you to keep your nurser colder than americans might be accustomed to but you can just ignore the color coding that the thermometer uses it wants your temperature to be in the light yellow range and go by the numbers shown a bit over priced for what it is you re paying for the stylish design important to note that its plug sticks out quite a bit from the unit so you can t have this flat against a wall it will stick out an inch or two not much else to say as it s just a thermometer 
1 2 if sitting the cup pressurizes and send milk up and out the straw if you don t catch it in time you will find a puddle of milk in your diaper bag or car seat also the handles have a small notch they need to click into if this isn t done the cup leaks at the collar not to mention the ears cause a small cavity that can be a pain to clean inside the cup if my wife hadn t of bought so many of them and my daughter loves them i would throw every last one away why not one star cause it s a cheap sippy cup really what was i expecting 
4 5 cute picture on the mat and large enough to cover a good portion of the table in front of the child it sticks well but can be pulled up at the edges by a child if they are determined i just like having something clean to put the food on rather than the table top 
5 5 this is such a great present for any baby they are cute fashionable and comfy perfect for your baby or for anyone you know having a baby this is a must buy 
1 1 does not stick
5 4 works great except got vaccum sealed a couple of times and i couldn t open it so i bought another thermos jar that has a different top easier to open 
5 5 these are the only pacifier my son would take as an infant now he is a year and a half and still refuses any other pacifier but these 
5 5 perfect thank you
5 5 one of the best safety door knobs for 2 plus year old i have a 2 5yr old n he hasn t figured out how to use it yet thank god 
5 5 good buy
5 5 this product is a true life saver thank you will definitely do business again 
4 2 two stars due to leak let me start by saying that this sprayer is phenomenal for rinsing soiled cloth diapers it is an easy install with handy shut off valve that prevents accidental sprayings and mischief from the older kids in the house good pressure and spray pattern make quick work of an otherwise messy task we made one ourselves for the first kid using a sink sprayer and several adapters no comparison here the osocozy is far superior and worth the extra please read on more on the leak ours had a small drip almost immediately over 2 months the drip has developed into a steady stream running out of the base of the sprayer whenever the valve is open just ordered a replacement luckily amazon provides a full refund for returned items and we beat the cut off for a restocking fee 
5 1 we thought the ottoman rocked as well and that is what we were hoping for it does not rock with the chair 
5 5 my granddaughter loved it 
5 4 kind of small
5 5 sight and sound allows for peace of mind while still being able to monitor adults who cannot be left alone 
5 5 you can t have a redneck baby without one of these 
5 5 i decided to try out these bottles after discovering that mam pacifiers are the only ones my daughter will actually suck on she s mostly breastfed but when i need to work do appointments i use these so others can feed her formula or pumped breastmilk it always takes her a minute to get used to drinking from it but it s the only bottles where she isn t constantly sucking air along with the milk i like that this package comes along with two pacifiers too since it seems like i m constantly misplacing washing them 
5 5 the babe loves them although he can t yet read 
4 4 4 stars onky because i wish they were cheaper great binkis
5 5 very lightweight my daughter is really picky about pacifiers the mam pacifiers and soothies have been the only ones i could get to work finally a pacifier i can use to attach to her so it doesn t get lost 
5 5 a vert pacifier
5 5 excelent product
5 5 super cute and shipped very fast thank you :)
5 5 this is the best no more lost pacifier my son loves to hold it and can easily put it back in his mouth 
5 5 our baby loves these and won t use the gummy pacifiers any more 
5 3 adorable
5 5 my grandson loves his monkey great characters
4 5 my baby prefers this one over the lion 5 stars 
5 5 great 
5 5 cute gift 
3 3 sent pink for my son 
5 5 glow in the dark is genius 
5 3 no problem child didn t like it kind of an expensive test
4 3 buying these as a gift for my baby granddaughter s stocking but they arrived baby boy blue colors design i was expecting pretty pink flowery as was pictured dissappointed but they ll still work next time i ll go to the store and pick the designs i want 
5 2 the middle of the paci has bumps and the nipple is weird my son doesn t like them 
5 5 our twin sons love these they are our mute buttons we ve ordered multiple packs of these and don t leave home without them we didn t really use pacifiers with our daughter but they ve been very helpful with the twins :)
5 5 love
5 5 these pacifiers are great they are the only ones my child will take 
5 5 gr8
5 5 my daughter is 3 months old formula fed we use these as well as the medela bottles and she seems to be a little less gassy with these at first i was concerned about the nipple shape it is not round its more like a squished oval but she likes the mam pacifiers so we decided to give it a try she likes them they are also very easy to clean the bottoms actually screw off as well as the tops and you can sterilize them in the microwave without using a bag or other sterilization contraption 
5 5 good
5 5 cute wife had to have it great present for the new arrivals 
1 2 in theory this is a great product yeah babies suck on pacifiers however my son could tell this wasn t a regular paci he would not keep it in his mouth and kept throwing it at me it might work better if the temperature was instant and they only had to suck it a minute it seems to take way to long to register i have tried several different thermometers for my son the forehead one works if your kid never moves the paci works if your kid never moves and will keep it in his mouth the rectal one works if your kid never moves or farts the best one is an ear thermometer yes your kid will move but these are fast one second in and out that s it temp taken tylonal given baby better end of story don t waste your money on this until it s improved again good idea in theory but i don t think the people that made it ever had a child 
5 5 the adorable animal keeps the paci in my baby s mouth until she can put it there herself the paci part is just like the ones they had at the hospital so baby had no problem transitioning she also likes chewing on the soft animal part we had no problem throwing them in the washing machine either 
5 5 these are fantastic they are really substantial and rugged they absolutely stay put really great buy 
4 1 not what i expected it needs to be a tad bit longer and the spoon wider and deeper holds nothing 
5 5 favorite bottle brush cleans really well without scratching dr browns bottles require some deep cleaning but this makes it much easier and it s worth it i swear by these bottles 
5 5 this stuff is amazing i used it to strip diapers and it worked amazingly so much mixed information on how to use it so i d research carefully depending on your machine type number of diapers type of issues etc once i worked out the magic combination for me it was great helped remove build up minerals smell etc 
5 5 if you are looking for something adorable for a babies first christmas this is it i can t wait to give it to my son stocking stuffer excellent quality and very soft i know this will become a favorite lovey its also a great way to keep a memory of a first christmas 
5 5 love love love i was wishing to find this product one day while exclusively pumping and i just love them i highly recommend this product line 
5 4 this stroller is lightweight and folds up real nice it folds compact and can store in any compact car the downside is that you might get pinched by the handlebars while pushing the carriage 
5 3 good
1 2 flimsy
3 2 can t get them to roll back up so they really don t get used don t know if i m doing something wrong but it shouldn t be that complicated if so 
5 3 cute but sort of boring not my kids favorite water gets stuck inside 
5 5 i have two lean little boys who had a constant problem with 34 droopy bottoms 34 the dapper snapper was a perfect solution it helps keep their pants up with out having to be unbuckled every time i change their diapers great design 
5 3 i loved the smaller version so much we purchased the same one in a larger model this one is flimsy and the puppy can bend it just by running into it my husband i spend a lot of time adjusting it that being said it does work for a larger space i just wish it was sturdier after three months of continuous use i think i should have gotten a different one 
5 5 this system is a real time saver you really need the bags bottles bottle warmer and nipples the storage tray i didnt find very necessary but it is still more economical to buy the set to start you out it is a great way to pump and feed for a working mom 
5 3 there are lots of pockets which is great but there were no stroller connector 
5 4 i purchased this item to have a lightweight alternative to our usual go to car seat snap n go carrier after our baby was six months old and able to sit upright with assistance she was able to sit comfortably in the seat without any concern of her head resting against the crossing frame bars in the back she would even nap in the seat since it offered a slight recline despite her being big for her age it worked great for quick trips into the store while traveling and sightseeing it is sturdy enough for us to drape the shoulder straps of the backpack we use in place of a traditional diaper bag over the handle bars without flopping over once the baby is taken out of it the only concern that made me not rate it as a five is the metal clamp that unlocks the stroller to fold it is hard to manipulate for some people especially those who are weak handed other than that for the price and functionality it is a great value 
5 5 the handles are easy for my baby to hold and i like to use it for bananas when we are out and about 
5 5 this is my second safari friends lunch box both my kids have used these since age 15 months they are very durable and very easy for little hands to work and figure out and very cute designs 
5 5 great price they love it
1 1 very disappointed in this product it s doesn t tighten and straps get twisted all the time poorly made will stick with britax for now on tried to save because it s used as a second seat but i am very disappointed
5 2 these shrink bad in the wash 
5 5 great product 
1 4 its okay but i returned and bought the munchkin brand instead 
1 1 gate was delivered on time but box seemed to be opened and used plastic zip ties were already cut like product had been returned before product was dusty and dirty there were no instructions and took two hours to put up very disappointed in amazon 
5 2 the corner design works well in our bathtub but the suction cups do not stay in place no matter how carefully you place them and we have a regular tub and surround no fancy or unusual materials 
5 5 perfect :)
5 5 everything is perfect and it shipped fast thank you my kids are going to love these 
5 5 big hit
1 1 the spring got stuck after just 2 months terrible quality 
5 5 this is amazing and such a help and time saver for twins highly recommend 
5 1 very cheap quality and they do not fit mam pacifiers which are my son s favorite i do not recommend purchasing 
5 5 looked all over for these bibs catches the mess nicely and the kids don t mind them on they are soft but work well 
5 5 worth the money lovey very soft quite lovable and my grand children still love them all even the threadbare ones 
1 1 don t waste your money on this monitor it has so much static and is very annoying i read all of the reviews and still purchased it but now i wish that i wouldn t have 
1 2 i ordered two of these for my 8 month old twins i was excited to see ones that worked with the avent soothie pacifiers unfortunately they don t stay on them within a few minutes my babies had a stuffed toy in one hand and a pacifier in the other maybe they d work better with other brands but their big selling point was that they worked with the soothies used them for less than a day what a waste 
5 4 our baby loves them durable 
5 5 great 
5 5 great quality product love the brushes they work the best so far with the ones i ve tried 
4 4 my daughter slept in this for nearly the first 6 months i kept it by my bed and could easily move it around the house the only problem we had was my daughter began only sleeping with her head turned one way so her neck became stiff and we had to work on laying her different ways so it didn t become a problem also it was quite difficult to transition to the crib once she had become accustomed to this but i m sure that s the same if you had used a regular bassinet 
5 5 twins are not yet born but the item is perfect compared to one having to be in front and one in back not a fan of those and easier to use 
5 4 awesome my baby loves this necklace and i love how it saves my face from little baby scratches and saves my tatas from getting bit the only thing i would say can improve is the necklace 
5 5 very pretty a perfect extra to decorate my granddaughters new bedroom 
4 4 i have 3 kids under 5 and would venture to say i m not the only parent who has found sippy cups to be an almost perpetually disappointing baby gear category mold spouts that get chewed on rather than sipped from leaks too much suction too little suction poor design i think i ve seen it all then add to that breastfed babies and toddlers who have taken longer to learn cup skills and been quite picky in short i ve been relieved when each child has 34 figured it out 34 and graduated to older kid cup options i bought this set for my 11 month old who is approaching weaning and really just starting to figure out cup skills the main things i was looking for were a 2 handle design hard spout she treats soft spouts like teething toys just the right 34 flow speed 34 not too much suction required to get fluid out this is a breastfed baby who hasn t had too many bottles yet not gushing either and of course no leaks when the valve is in place what s great 1 the size holds enough fluid for an older baby yet isn t too tall taller cups seem more awkward for a cup learner to tip and maneuver 2 the spout the shape seems intuitive for my picky breastfed daughter and it s hard enough that it isn t getting the 34 chew toy treatment 34 3 they stack hooray for space saving 4 the flow comes out without excessive suction yet doesn t flow so fast as to make a mess 5 so far leak free it s been well tested through dropping tipping shaking etc what i m concerned about mold and mildew so far we are squeaky clean but the cup is harder to clean than the sippy cups i use for my older children because of the shape of the underside of the spout it has some 34 valleys 34 and crevices similar to the equivalent playtex sippy cups which i am no fan of and will need a thorough clean after each use and regular trips to the dishwasher in order to keep nasty growths at bay it may be completely fine with good care or it may not i will update this review when i ve had the cup longer and adjust my rating as needed 
5 5 love this bag and the color and ordered from elephantearsonline they have great customer service i ve ordered from them before i m not sure if it was them or amazon who packaged the bag though because the packaging got seriously bent from the outside and as a result the bottom of the bag was bent as well it s kind of reshaped itself after being stuffed and stored and amazon worked with me to resolve the issue the sashay is a great bag this is the second one i have right now but i have had a total of five of them i have a petuniaproblem form and function works well for moms and any time you might have to carry more stuff and would like to at least have the option of being hands free the only things i would caution on are 1 shallow outer bottle pockets 2 it s a deep bag so you need to figure out a system to organize it personally ppb powder room cases are a favorite of mine and i would recommend those as well 
5 5 none available 
5 5 to early christmas isn t here yet
5 4 love this idea for a baby gate rather than those you need to put up and take down repeatedly these were a gift for my son daughter in law who have a 1 yr old and another on the way the gates keep the baby safe from the stairs and give the dog a break from the baby 
5 5 cute and very warm
4 5 cute bag i gave it 5 stars because the price is so cheap especially for a winnie the pooh item with a very cute print because it was so cheap i wasn t expecting much it s just a simple bag nothing fancy no inside pockets just 34 bands 34 on the inside to tuck things into like diapers the outside has the pouches for storage my only problem was the bag is actually pretty blue in color and you can t really tell from the picture how blue it is light blue a baby blue color but not nearly as 34 white 34 blue as the picture seems i actually thought it would be white it is very blue 
5 5 they are what they are no issues
5 5 the product is solid fit well stay tied and keep baby s feet warm and soft organic 
5 5 grandson loved it
5 5 excelent
5 3 i d give this 5 stars if it worked because it s a beautiful and wonderfully made necklace and delivered quickly it arrived and i was eager to use it for my teething baby as i finally broke down and believed the mom s who said it is a miracle for a teething baby i did not see any less drooling as other moms said and my baby did not do any less crying with or without it they said give it time to work but i figure if it s on long enough she will eventually have good days i love the necklace but it s not a miracle cure for my baby 
4 5 i love everything about this seat except it s weight it is a tank so difficult to carry around and put in multiple cars however it s ease of installation makes it ideal for various cars so it s a contradiction i can tell you though since buying a evenflo sureride for grandmas car and a diono rainier for my husband s that they are all cumbersome and difficult to install so if they are all going to be a pain to carry then you might as well have one that s easy to install and to install properly 
5 3 smaller than i thought it would be need to change bags often good odor control until you change bags of course 
5 4 nuk bottle is good for my baby
5 5 awesome it works 
5 5 love it fast delivery
5 5 i bought these kits waaaaaay cheaper at sweetbottoms comi bought two of these kits and they re awesome i d say i need two more for a complete newborn stash super simple to use n wash 
5 5 perfect gift for my godchild and she loves it while playing dress got it in 2013 for xmas and it still looks brand new from daily play dress up she was three and is going on five great gift for the busy child assembly is what her dad does no nicks or scratches even today 
5 5 love my baby is almost 6 months old now i started with the breastfeeding gift set after research and reviews the baby switched from breast to nipple and never had a problem i have never had a bag leak the direct pump is wonderful when you are half asleep and stressed with your newborn the bags store nicely in the fridge and freezer and transport great in freezer packs the costs of the bags seem to be moderate the warming system the kozi is a must it never failed me at all hours of the night everyone asks me what bottle system i have and i cannot boast enought about this the pump adapters fit my medela perfectly with no leakage best bags best one handed bottle system quick and safe warming system you can t go wrong 
5 4 delivered quickly even has nipple caps couldn t be more satisfied 
5 1 the mouthpiece doesn t allow sufficient space for the nose baby can t use it 
5 5 great 
5 5 very nice and so soft i like it cause it is a little bigger then the normal baby blankets 
4 3 it was easy enough to put together wasn t as hard as some claim it to be but the movement part didn t roll very well though we just removed the walker part after he started standing and then removed the top and laid it on the floor my boy beat the crap out it and the we gave it to another young couple for there new born only used it for like 4 5 months 
5 4 didn t have the same cover as the picture but it helped wedge my belly up while sleeping on my side it really saved my back i still use it two years later in my car as a soft seat 
5 5 great quality product very cute and they don t leak 
5 3 cheaply made peeling particle board and falling apart after 2 years i suppose this is the life expectancy of a diaper changing table 
5 5 fantastic product we have had this for several months and the overall quality is outstanding excellent picture features and battery life 
5 5 this is my son s favorite 
5 5 great
3 1 i also received the pacifier in the wrong color i didn t read over the reviews because my baby was already using this brand of pacifier so i didn t see the trouble others had written of when the description said colors may vary i was expecting it to have a different design or some other slight variation i was not expecting to get pink with hearts on them for my little boy now it always works out that the only pacifiers i can find when i am rushing out of the house are the pink ones 
4 4 our son loses his pacifier in the night and thought this was a good solution that he might be able to grab this instead of waking us up he does find it and play with it in the night he just doesn t like the pacifier he prefers a different kind the times he has tried this the giraffe looks like a nice size to hang on the pacifier not too big and heavy i gave it 4 stars not because he doesn t like it i wish the pacifier could come off of the giraffe so you could replace just the pacifier if needed 
5 4 our 7 month old son s favorite paci since he was a month old downside they are clear and easily lost and they sometimes get moisture inside the nipple when cleaning one has a completely fogged nipple because i can t get in there and scrub it 
5 5 wonderful pacifiers love this brand 
5 5 my sons favorite pacifier :)
5 5 great pacifiers 
5 5 just as described best to get a clip to attach to these as they hop all over the floor in which i lost many of them 
5 5 after 6 mo these are very good stick them in the freezer as use as a teether ;)
5 4 it s adorable nice and soft our son uses it to snuggle with but as stated in other reviews the arm of the bear is just a tad too short for baby to suck his paci a nuby and hold the bear at the same time when the connected paci is in his mouth the bear just sits in his chest it s a bummer it didn t quite work it seemed if the binkbeay arm did reach it would do the trick of helping him transition off the paci 
5 3 product seems like it is poor quality as the mustache feels like clay and could break very easily it is a novelty item so don t expect a great pacifier i got the picture i wanted though so task complete 
5 5 so cute
4 4 very cute and durable i wish the pacifier looked like the picture the design is very faded can hardly see the glitter and zebra print is more gray than black but i still like it otherwise i would give it a 5 
4 4 these are slightly larger than the stage 1 pacifiers in places the bulb that goes in the mouth and the hard plastic front my son didn t want to switch to these at first but now he loves them i only wish that they came in solid colors and or more neutral tones the orange is not really attractive and the gender neutral designs are even worse 
5 4 nothing bad to say about these my son won t take the other old school pacifiers lol whatever their called the brown ones he only likes these clear ones nuk is one of the best baby brands out there my daughter used these and nuk silicone bottles til she was maybe 6mons after that she wouldnt take pacifiers anymore shes now 3 so i m glad i don t have 2 paci babies but anyway so i knew i wouldnt have any issues with them i just dont like that even though it said basketball when i placed the order they still sent me foot ball i could see if it said colors may vary but it didtnt it said basketball and showed the basketalls on the pic so you guys need to give people what they think their paying for its hard enough ordering from pictures as it is all we can do is take your word from the description get it toghether 
5 5 great product 
5 5 love these pacifiers they are nice and small so they don t over consume the baby s entire face 
5 5 i simply loves this pacifiers very easy to sterilize them 
5 5 cute colors
5 5 good
5 5 what would we do without this my daughter loves her wubbunub 
1 1 this was poorly made and i didn t even use it at the baby shower do not buy 
1 1 i didn t like the color my baby is a boy and i recept pink and red 
5 5 these are great 
5 5 good
5 5 i just love the look and they are easy to clean my three month has no issue going from nipple to bottle 
5 5 this pacifire is so cute cant wait to buy more 
5 5 great deal for pacis different designs yet still girlish as well
5 5 we love 34 wubbies 34 and get a new one for each baby and every baby shower as a gift to friends the wubbanub is the only paci you should get they re easy to find in the dark when you re fumbling around the crib same goes for the carseat when you re doing the reach around while driving trying to calm a screaming kid best yet is that kiddos can start to get it into their own mouth unassisted much easier most hospitals use soothi paci s anyway so this is an easy transition and the nipple shape and design is similar to the dr brown s shape for those using them and worried about too much nipple confusion my favorite design thus far is the dragon adorable 
5 4 i do love this pacifier because it s easy to clean and can easily be boiled however it s heavier than others and tends to fall out of my baby s mouth 
5 4 my grandson s favorite pacifier 
5 5 so adorable and perfect for christmas thank you 
5 5 my baby loves them good time on shipment very good quality 
5 5 good product
5 5 great pacifiers besides that the baby loves them i love them because when it s dark in his room and he s yelling and i just need to find his pacifier and put it back in his mouth and can t find it but now with the glow in the dark it makes it much easier to find 
5 5 my son loves only this brand and it s easy to find them at night 
5 4 they don t glow in the dark for long but i love the mam pacifiers my son prefers them over others 
5 4 the glow in the dark doesn t last long at all but i love the pacifiers themselves my son likes the mam pacifiers more than others 
5 5 love it 8 months later its still as good as new i wash it by hand once ever 7 10 day with a small amount of dreft and dab of bleach soak it air dry it or blow dry it if i need it faster definitely would recommend this buy 2 i didn t but while one is drying wit would have made life so much easier to have a second one buy this you will not regret it for your baby or a gift inexpensive but would make an amazing shower gift 
5 5 love these keeps pacifiers clean and easy to locate in the diaper bag i ve never used the clip handle so i m not sure about it s durability 
5 5 fit perfect in my baby s koi pink play yard :)
5 5 fits perfectly the cameleon bugaboo stroller very good quality love the options to use either the fleece cover or the duvet cover seems very comfortable and very warm baby looks super happy i can only wish something like that existed when i was a baby 
5 5 i absolutely love how big this mirror is i bought it for my daughter so she could keep an eye on her own daughter without her having to turn around while driving and taking her eyes off the road what i didn t pay attention to was that there is a pivot that allows her to adjust and it s a feature she really like her daughter can see herself in the mirror and it s helped to entertain here when the travel not all products are worth their price but this one is 
5 5 good to train kids it s comfortable
5 4 i got this when my son was just 2 months old and this was where i would put him on his tummy time now he s 6 months and he loves this play gym i would give it a 5 if this was a little larger in size 
5 4 good set
5 5 it s hard to find these bottles anywhere and this is such an awesome price 
5 4 it s very famous friends recommend me to buy it for my kid to ease his teeth it turn out to be very effective usually baby hold its neck and eat its head but my kid likes to eat one of its foot and stab other feet in his face i try to correct him but no use however it s a great toy
5 5 so far so good no leaks small setting fits perfectly on my newborn 7lbs 12oz and poo easily wipes off if when i am changing him some accidentally gets on the cover 
4 4 very nice set for preschoolers but a little pricey i would still recommend it 
5 4 does what it s supposed to do inexpensively i m satisfied with it 
1 1 baby wipes dried out quickly in this container don t waste your money 
5 5 so much room and such style i love using this bag it holds all the essentials plus extras i adore the stroller straps but worry about how heavy the bag may be i will update as time goes on so far the bag has held up perfect 
5 5 such a cute theme my daughter is going to love it for her new room decor 
5 2 i just received these in the mail as part of a set with lamp and mobile to see these retail so much by themselves is pretty crazy i m disappointed in the quality of artwork it looks so much better in the pic online than real it literally looks like someone took some markers and cheap paint and hand painted the decor on cheap canvas the only nice thing are the sayings which were obviously done in stencil i could have done something better myself it was a gift and is part of baby girls nursery so i will still use but if you are considering this for artwork id recommend spending your money elsewhere 
5 5 good product served its purpose well 
5 2 nice bag and loved the fact it was made in usa big problem is the zipper there is a gap between the end and the closure i would not recommend this for anything that could spill crumbs or that could dry out 
5 5 after our 1st week with this car seat we are beyond satisfied our taller than average 2 year old rides super comfortably and best of all he sleeps soundly without any head flopping forward issues very satisfied 
5 5 if i could do 10 stars i would the customer service is just absolutely awesome i needed these asap so i contacted the seller and got an email within the hour once the details were discussed and decided upon it really was shipped out immediately the mittens themselves really are bigger than the newborn ones and they re soft and cute wish i bought these earlier 
5 5 practical looks good and the baby loves it 
1 1 every single one disintegrated within two months of use the quality of this product is not good if you wash it on cold and line dry you might have more success but who has time for that kind of work with a newborn it s also very difficult to scrub out the poo even when using oxyclean i washed in warm water and dried on low but they still failed 
5 5 so far love this stroller its definitely heavy to carry but its a smooth ride for the kids im very happy with this 
5 4 for the money it s good 
5 4 great potty the music helps teach to close the lid when done and also let s me know when she is done 
5 5 great car seat easy to install my son loves his new big boy seat 
5 5 easy to install and use
5 5 this is a great organizer i bought another one as a gift 
4 4 my kid loved it and for that i want to give it 5 stars but unfortunately it only played 3 melodies plus 2 where it played a few notes and then stopped even so this was one of my son s favorite toys therefore i still give it 4 stars 
5 5 great stuff for bottle feeding 
5 5 excellent product
5 5 just as described perfect system for storing with ease 
5 5 great for toddlers
1 1 these aspirators do not work i purchased a second one thinking the first one i bought was s did but nope spend your money on something else the bulbis too hard yo decompress and when it does its way too slow to be effective cheap junk 
5 4 loved it
3 3 it s too bulky not exactly what i hoped for but i m sure it is exactly as described in the ad 
4 4 i wish it had a handle other than that is great 
5 5 sturdy and strong can be used for a baby just learning to sit or can t sit as the back of the chair reclines also the tray table moves forward and back as baby gets bigger the chair cover can easily come of for washing as well i love it
5 3 i love the idea of these spoons but twice i ve received spoons that are chipped which isn t safe for baby to eat with 
5 5 cute little book that is fish shaped there are only a few cloth pages but just enough to keep the 13 month old entertained it s a good size that she likes to open it and study each page we ve seen her tell a story in her way then she laughs and claps as she turns the pages 
5 3 good for the money 
5 2 the plastic around the frame is all scratched up and damaged the actual frame even has some scratches on it looks like it s been through the ringer and it s supposed to be brand new 
5 5 wonderful item it serves a great purpose to keep my baby from running off into parking lots etc and it doubles as a small diaper bag that she can carry herself 
1 2 i guess you get what you pay for i honestly think that the 14 99 price is asking too much for the quality of this product the wood was very cheap and cracked very easily the adjustment was either too tight or too loose and didn t fit in either place i tried to place it i did give it 2 stars as i received this product very quickly i returned this product the next day 
5 5 beautiful and functional not as strong as some other gates but gets the job done i like it bc i can open with one hand and slam shut as i walk through 
5 5 brother sister n law said it gets lots of use very pretty 
4 5 this is a great bouncy seat it is a little difficult to change the batteries but otherwise we loved it 
5 5 bought this for my great nephew he loves it it glides easily on tile and low pile carpet great gift for toddlers 
3 3 i really like the sounds and effects it has sadly my 9month old didn t find much interest in it he just throws it but hopefully later on he ll have a blast with it my boyfriend and i have fun with it though xd we like twisting it a lot 
5 5 my son loves this thing he usually hates tummy time but he enjoys looking at himself so now he likes tummy time :)
5 2 this sheet is soft but poor quality after a few washes the elastic lost its stretch and the stitching has become frayed 
5 5 as expected 
5 5 loved these as a new mom i had trouble with engorgement and over production of milk these fit right in my bra and worked with assisting in letdown using warm and then using the cold to help with pain after feeds i also loved using them warm when i have had a couple blocked ducts 
5 5 my daugher loves her pillow and is only 15 months she snuggles it and sleeps with it i recommend 
5 5 i bought as a gift for a friend and it was a hit the baby is not born yet so i can t tell you that he liked it but i am sure that we will have a lot of fun pictures 
3 3 it s okay
5 5 great for little hands well worth the couple of bucks 
5 5 cute
5 5 favorite
5 4 a very useul bottle specially for long time picnic or shopping love it
5 5 perfect for traving and so easy to use 
5 5 my 1 1 2 year old grandson rolled the balls over and over and over again great simple fun 
3 4 cheap and does the job should let the buyer pick the color would be more popular i think 
5 4 great crib fits in smaller spaces yet sleeping area is standard easy to put together 
5 5 beautiful nice construction easy to attach pictures i would buy it again 
5 5 love it 
4 4 overall good bag the washing instructions do recommend that it be hung up to dry which is not as convenient but overall it functions well 
5 5 loved this
5 5 my baby loved this it kept her attention it s well made and sturdy
5 4 perfect size for my 2 year old she loves it and actually slept better when she used this pillow versus other brands i would definitely buy more 
5 5 we received this as a gift to use with the uppababy bassinet it was super easy to put together i did it myself without help from the husband and it looks exactly like the photo it s slightly larger than the bassinet itself which we knew from the measurements listed but the bassinet stays in it securely we love the rocking feature which was a major reason that we decided to get this instead of the uppababy brand it is a bit shorter than other bassinet stands but again we knew this from the description and for the price you can t beat it we can t wait to use it 
5 5 great for travelling
5 5 purchased for my youngest s pre k naptimes decently made thicker than i expected pillow is removable for washing stitching holding up well with it s weekly wash wish we d had these for the 2 elders 
3 3 for the price this pack n play playard works the main problem is that the bassinet boards sag so if you place the baby in length wise the baby s head or bum is raise a bit the boards width wise so from the side the board looks like a 34 w 34 not that extreme but sort of if you place the baby width wise it works fine as the baby is only on one board however lengthwise is better so baby can look out the mesh at parents it cleans decently well we also have a chicco play yard that costs twice as much but doesn t sag 
5 5 works perfect
5 4 this is surely to be something that my newborn comes to love soon it is soft and cuddly and comes in a nice satin bag 
5 5 no mess perfect 
5 5 i adore my baby k tan it was a learning experience putting it on and using it the first few times after i got use to it it became a lifesaver it s super fast and easy to use my baby now a young toddler loves being in it the different positions really allow it to grow with baby i really got good at being able to nurse in it completely discreetly while shopping this is actually the second one i ve ordered for a friend my husband says he wants one in his size if we have more kids 
5 5 my great grand son loved it he ate all his baby food and fell asleep in the chair it is his first high chair 
5 5 excelent
5 5 perfect addition to our uppababy vista we get complements on it all the time holds most water bottles and has that hidden covered compartment in the middle where we carry personal stuff like cellphone and wallet without everyone to see it also magnetically snaps shut without making noise an issue with sleeping kids in the stroller the velcro seems really strong and keeps it in its place on the stroller we also haven t had to take it off to fold the stroller which is also nice it was a good buy 
5 5 bought this decoration for my granddaughter s first christmas this is precious ornament much cuter than expected 
5 5 super cute made in usa 
5 5 this dresser is perfect it is really built well very sturdy and definitely has some weight to it my husband and i love it and we know our baby will too 
2 2 while this spout cover is cute and does the job of protecting my kids from bumping their heads it became black inside i would think that something that s made to get wet would be mold resistant but this isn t it s very disappointing since it s really gross inside and very hard or impossible to clean it 
3 3 very durable doesnt leak but kinda hard to suck through 
5 1 i am exclusively pumping for my little one and needed a manual pump to help empty my breasts after using my electric pump it hasn t even been a week since this arrived used it only 4 5 times and it has already lost suction not worth the buy look into another manual pump 
5 5 my grand baby loves it 
5 5 love this so easy to use
5 5 easy install great seat for the cost 
5 5 this is he best it really helps prevent flathead on newborn babies i bought this when our infant was four months old i wish i had known about the noggin earlier every home with a newborn should own one 
5 5 excellent bathrobe exactly as advertised and more so my wife ordered three different animal robes for gifts and they were a huge hit soft comfortable and most important great quality also unlike some products the bathrobes actually looked like the picture which is what we were hoping for this will be our go to gift for all newborns babies you will not be sorry if you order this product 
5 5 new momma to be loved it
5 2 these only work with very minimal leakage i have woken up several times with a wet bra and not because the pads werent on properly definitely not good for overnight 
5 3 very cute and sturdy but with my toddler who runs around non stop it s difficult to maneuver the harness it gets wrapped around him or me 
5 5 not sure what we would ve done without this baby loves it newborn must have 
5 5 these are totally adorable and great for keeping baby s ankles warm as well as for easy diaper changing and i like that they are boy designs :)
5 5 its great waterproof and very warm looks smart and just as nice as more expensive versions perfect for the east coast winter plus faster than anticipated delivery 
5 1 i ve retouned because the screan did not work well
5 5 this is great you can fit two soothies in it 
5 5 experience is good
5 5 adorable the baby looks so cute 
5 5 as described
5 4 baby loves these he also could poke his hand into his mouth still because of the holes which i m not sure is a plus or minus
5 5 its a super cute binky but my son doesn t like pacifiers lol oh well 
5 5 my littlest one only likes mam binkies spits all others out not sure why but i l take it
5 5 my nine month old loves these i love them too easy to keep clean i really like the doctor brown s line of products 
5 5 very good video quality in lighted and dark conditions 
5 3 the ones we got when this was a lightning deal definitely from this item page do not have the handle part protruding from the shield they have the same design on them but the front that doesn t go into our baby s mouth is flat with a few holes cut out just feels misleading to get a different product than what s pictured especially since it s useful to have a handle that s why many pacifiers have one and why the original design had one the case feels cheap too and i m not sure it s actually bpa free like the pacifiers are promised to be wouldn t want that leaching i will update this review if the company promises all cases ever produced for this item have been bpa free as well fortunately our baby seems to like them after being weirded out on the first try 10 minutes later she was asleep with one of them that said the unexplained difference from the product images and low quality looking case are enough to deduct two stars 
5 5 love these things they are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs washable reusable and cute i have hand washed them and machine washed them they have held up very well and hold a lot of food much nicer than a ziploc and easier for little hands to use a zipper like this 
5 4 can cover a lot 
5 3 the microsuede liner is the nicest of any stay dry liner i ve used but the flap to stuff these is in an odd location and likes to flip up after its stuffed i haven t had any poo go inside the liner but i can see that it easily could they also don t feel like they should cost as much as they do honestly i d put them at just a nudge above alvababy your still getting just microfiber inserts afterall 
5 5 good
5 5 love these make a nice room upgrade 
5 5 we use daily for feeding our 1 and 4 year old kids breakfast durable through a year of daily dishwasher cleaning green plastic part pops off but is easy to put back on 
5 5 we had one of these before and it lasted a long long time until a big man stepped on it so i love this pack of the m the lil ones will love these 
5 5 these will be great for a christmas gift exchange items were delivered very quickly
5 5 i cannot stop playing picturing my nephew with pacifier in his mouth i can t wait until he comes back so that i can snap a gazillion photos of him with it 
5 5 soooo cute nothing more to be said all of my kids have used and loved wubbanubs 
4 2 product gets water and saliva in the sucking part not sealed well had to throw it away for fear of some kind of bacterial infection that could possibly grow inside of it then being ingested by child health risk i did not wish to take chances with other than that it was a funny novelty product 
5 5 we love wubbanubs my son has never used anything put these since the day he was born they are very durable and washable 
5 5 good
3 3 it ok not what i want don t willy glow in the dark but thank you
5 5 i bought the first one in 2010 and it s still working getting another because of more disabilities sticks great to my fiberglass shower insert i check to make sure the suction cup is tight every once in a while the top one has a tendency to work loose but it is a lot more reliable than the suction cups on the shower caddies i ve bought and replaced 
5 5 great child lock for your door wall keeps little kids from opening the door but is easy for adults to open 
5 5 our grandson loves this seat 
5 5 perfect size for a toddler our son has adjusted to a bigger pillow but our daughter is just getting ready for her own bed it really is the perfect size i can t stress this enough and add in hypoallergnic to it too we have a few allergy sufferers in our family so we require this in a pillow 
5 5 i love how absorbent and trim these are i can use alone or add just one of these as a doubler during the night and my 7 month old will last all night 10 hours 
5 4 great to have for on the go
5 5 no fluff here it is what it is and it serves its purpose in protecting the crib rails fits our wider front crib rail easy to apply toy tethers are a great addition 
2 3 very thin but large enough other way the material is good but wouldn t buy again because of the thickness
4 3 i thought the board is should be more bigger but it wasn t well my little baby was so happy the board 
5 5 this item was a birthday gift to my granddaughter i m told that she enjoys playing with her baby stroller the baby stroller is sturdy and well constructed i did order this item at the last minute but because i have amazon prime the package arrived in time for my granddaughter s birthday party 
1 5 i thought we could get away with just using a trash can in until our room started to seriously smell 
5 5 works very well
5 1 hello because i have delayed my article because hera thursday that it had to receive
5 5 my grandbaby loves her chair she is truly a tv lover opting for such deep and moving films as cloudy with a chance of meatballs any kid 3 years old will love this chair 
5 4 great
1 4 had a recall on the buckle
5 5 my 10 month old loves these i stack them and she knocks them down and gets very excited they are a hard rubbery material so she enjoys 34 chewing 34 on them as well very happy with this purchase 
1 1 i washed these sheets before trying to put them on the mattress and they have shrunk so much that i cannot even force them on and now that i have washed them they cannot be returned i am extremely disappointed that i wasted my money 
5 5 great for baby proofing the house 
5 5 very good product it was what i expected i recommend hundred percent i would definitely buy this product again 
5 3 it just floats on top of the water i was looking for one that would swim underwater 
2 1 i thought the whole screen would light up but no just the little picture in the corner did my 16 mth baby really wanted nothing to do with it i was pretty disappointed :(
3 2 this will not work with all jugs better to get the screw on that will be more universal
5 5 never had one bad experience using these bags never leaked for me very nice size and affordable 
5 5 thanks
5 5 true to size and proportioned well body is of white stiff material tho
5 2 we have gone through so many lids cracking and breaking we ve only lost one bottle ever but have lost 4 lids due to cracking splitting 
5 5 easy and looks cute the clay does dry 34 soft 34 which is fine just didn t expect a puff paint consistency 
5 5 great price great product we have a giant puppy that s not ready to roam the house so keeping her in the kitchen with this gate has been a huge help it s strong enough to keep a large puppy inside as she jumps on it and bangs at it we have a wide opening between our kitchen and dining room and this gate was easy to manage to create the perfect size we needed 
5 4 works great but remains most after use 
5 5 this product was made very well but my grandson didn t like being in there so we use it as a gate 
1 2 worked well for first 2 months then started to alarm in the middle of the night which scared my husband and i thought our son was not breathing well it was a malfunction because it would alarm while we were holding him in our arms i sent back because of the defect and the company did testing for 14 days they said there was no malfunction and would send me back the snuzago i asked for a refund or a replacement but had no luck they do not test on real babies just some kind of simulated motion to mimic a baby i refuse to put this unit back on my baby as it is defective anyone in the company would not use it as well i am sure it is not reliable and wakes both my baby and us up at least once a night it worked well for 2 months but totally not worth 89 99 for 2 months terrible customer service 
5 4 i saw the playmat and instantly i loved it it s very pretty for the baby as well it looks comfortable 
5 5 our 5 month old loves to hold this and of course put it in his mouth he even snuggles with it plus it s safe to put in the washer and dryer which makes cleaning it a breeze 
5 5 bought two have one downstairs to change the baby on and one in the baby bag
5 5 great car seat love that it can grow with the child 
5 5 excellent purchase
5 5 grandbaby loves it 
5 5 very cute and decent sized about the size of a football i bought this for my 2 5 year old for christmas because it is a simple traditional design without any messy glitter or glued on pieces to be an issue 
5 2 not soft for a new born baby i don t like it 
5 4 the owl hat was made just like photo showed it is cute and i know i will use it as a photo prop thanks
5 5 washable and cute much nicer to use than a ziploc the zipper is easy for my little one to use too washed by hand and in the washing machine they hold up great these are made out of the same material as the wonderful bumkins bibs hold a perfect amount of goldfish for a day out on the town 
3 4 fit really well but not nearly as soft as i had hoped fingers crossed for softening up with regular washing 
5 5 very comfortable attractive and useful 
5 5 this soo cute i have a dog who flips out if someone knocks or rings the door bell this helps 
4 3 good product i just wish my son liked to be carrying in it more often 
5 4 we cut these in half because they are huge but they work great 
5 5 received this as a baby shower gift for my now nearly 2 year old and i still use it constantly year round when she was a newborn this blanket was awesome at keeping her warm during the winter house car dash and for naps in the car i baby wore and i frequently just tied this blanket onto my carrier and tucked under the ends if the weather got chilly perfect for walks in the stroller great all purpose no bulk packable easy travel usable long term item that will make your life easier not more cluttered 
4 1 great monitor in the beginning after 13 month 1 month past warranty the camera lost the ability to move and zoom in too much money for something that ll break in 13 months like i said it worked great for 13 months but i rated it one star because i expected it to last a little longer 
5 5 beautiful headbands
5 5 its took a time for my daughter to get use to it but it was worth it no leaking nice color 
5 1 was too small for bassinet pad
5 5 great
5 5 perfect fit for little babies only thing that did not swamp our little guy 
5 5 good 
5 5 it really works my daughter suffer from constipation i used the windy and helped her instantly totally recomended
5 5 very good quality it fits small good for pre kinder only
5 5 thirsties duo wraps give the trimmest fit i ve found so far and i ve tried blueberry coveralls rumparooz planetwise and thirsties they don t cut into my baby s legs while making the waist fit properly like the other covers and the velcro makes for a quick change especially if baby is being fussy during a diaper change 
5 5 my son started chewing on his crib like a typical and i purchased these because i needed to cover his crib rails and they have been washed and chewed on and washed again and they are still in great condition and they were at a great price 
5 5 nice quality fits a standard oval shape bassinet mattress 
5 5 best bottle brush hands down 
5 5 i bought this because i m always dropping stuff in the middle of the seats and it s a pain i usually have to get out of the car and on my knees to get whatever i dropped i still find stuff months later when i vacuum my car out but these work great you are always a safer driver with this product i can t say thank you enough for making this highly recommended you ll wonder how you got along without one all these years 
5 5 very nice and very good quality easy to follow assembly instructions 
5 5 comfy for those little ones who love their bath to kick free and splash with joy 
4 5 granddaughters like them seem to be working out very well 
3 3 the pacifier itself is fine i have other versions of this pacifier and bought this 34 nighttime 34 version specifically for its glow in the dark feature this line of avent pacifier is pretty light with mostly clear plastic therefore when you are looking for it in the middle of the night to give it to the baby it s almost impossible to find it unless you turn on the lights i thought the glow in the dark handle was a great idea and would eliminate the night issue unfortunately it only glows in the dark for a few minutes after turning the light off this defeats the purpose of why i bought the 34 nighttime 34 version 
1 1 useless
5 5 soft cute and easy for baby to hold
5 5 hilarous
5 5 my little guy loved these pacifiers when he was a newborn still has some he uses every now and then and he is 8 mo tha old now 
5 1 can buy cheaper at walmart
5 5 no more searching for paci in the middle of the night 
5 5 grand daughter loves them and they are cheaper than any store do recommend these 
5 2 it will hold onto the tiles for a while and then out of the blue it will come off i can t really trust it with my safety 
5 5 yes i love it will give it at shower with lots of animal print baby clothes 
4 3 overall good one one major problem is that the screw on the bottom came off within few rides we bought screws from home depot and fixed it however it did not last more than couple of trips we changed the screw few times and every time it falls off pretty soon 
4 3 nice seat but the straps are too small so i can t buckle my son in this was disappointing because one of the reasons i got the chair was because my son is large for his age and too big for the other floor seats like bumpo i like that you can use as an infant and booster seat and the tray tucks away nicely 
5 5 we use cloth 90 of the time it really isn t as bad as everyone makes it out to be her skin looks amazing no rashes ever these covers are amazing they have a flap on each end that holds the cloth diaper in no need for pinning at all i have tried about 10 different types brands and this is the easiest one for us as long as the cover doesn t get gross you only have to change the insert we have one set of the flip over night inserts they are lovely but expensive we use a cheaper prefold and they work perfectly we plan on giving a cover to each pregnant mommy we know 
5 5 love the zipper protection works great for keeping bodily and animal fluids from ruining the mattress my dog is normally great but had a bladder infection and wet the bed this saved the mattress and it all washed out the terry cloth is also a huge improvement over the cotton tops because it doesn t get caught and pull fall apart 
2 2 i ordered these cups for my son when i received them i got a 2 pack of pink cups granted the description does say colors may vary but you would think if i ordered masculine looking cups i d get something in masculine or at the very least neutral colors not pink well i guess this boy will be getting in touch with his feminine side again poor guy he was finally going to get something new not hand me downs from his sister 
5 5 we love halo sleep sacks our 6 mo old sleeps longer and better in this than a blanket swaddle or just jammies 
5 5 great christmas gift for a prissy little one 
5 1 i hate this thing i heard great reviews so i bought it hiping itd help with my discomfort i m 5 2 and 140lbs 7 months pregnant i don t know how anyone finds a comfortable position with this thing it s super firm and not flexible at all my body just doesn t fit in it i want to return it but already threw the packaging out like an idiot so i guess i have a 50 cat bed awesome 
4 3 i like it but it was missing a piece it was suppose to come with three small drawers but i only got two small drawers i like it enough to keep it for the price it wasn t worth all the work to exchange it and it will serve its purpose 
5 4 excellengt
5 4 baby likes to play this but the battery gone so quick
5 4 kid loves it
5 5 still in perfect condition after 2 years of abuse 
5 5 awesome i loved it it really helped my baby sleep better and longer i started using it when she was about a month and a half old she kept breaking out of the other swaddle sleep sack i had she would cry and struggle for a bit when she was first put in it but that got better as she got use to it it also made middle of the night nursing really easy i stopped using it right at 3 month she started getting really annoyed with it in the early morning thrashing around and struggling to get out it was always really cute when i would first release her from the swaddle she would be super happy and stretch out a whole lot i definitely recommend this product it worked great for us even it was just for a month and a half 
5 5 i wasn t sure hands free pumping would be a possibility but this holds the pump cups on nice and tight for perfect suction it s soft and comfy and is made with quality material so it will last 
5 5 great
5 5 a very light and roomy bag with multiple loops and pockets weight is important considering how much stuff you have to pack with you when you go out unlike most diaper bags it fits in the bottom part of our stroller so we don t have to lug it around with us to give you an idea of just how roomy it is we can fit 10 diapers wipes a changing pad 2 3 wash cloths a change of clothes a toy or two and a pretty thick blanket 
5 4 air this rug or for about a week and you will love it i couldn t smell anything after that time has prevented many bumps to the head during play 
5 4 brushes are great the sponges are a great addition but i feel like they are going to break off soon but for at least a month they are doing great 
5 5 daughter loves to throw and loves these much easier than dr brown s if looking for a glass bottle 
5 4 great i just wish there were more lights or moving lights the moving leaves and animals are great and brightly colored so the baby actually likes them and pays attention and we had no problem attaching it to giggle crib 
5 5 we have tried several diaper pail liners and this is by far my favorite brand we use this liner in the ubbi pail we always hang it to dry 
2 2 these were pretty pointless although a great idea its hard to fill them and hard to clean them and they didn t last very long 
5 5 these are really nice sippy cups my only comment would be they are on the large side 
5 5 love it s
1 5 the only bottle my son would drink from after 3 months 
5 5 really easy to get in and out of the car if you need something that moves straps are great and easy to get my son in and out of too i recommend loosening and tightening every time you get the child in and out one pull on the front strap tightens it right back up 
5 5 super soft one of my sons favorite stuffed animals he sleeps with it every night 
4 4 i think these bottles are an older model because the caps are different didn t like the caps they were rough plastic vs the slippery shinny ones 
5 5 i m a fan just brought my newborn home last week and he loves to stare at the pretty colors on the ceiling i also like that i can use the glow from the projector as a mild lamp and see baby s face and such in the night when i check on him without having to turn on any lights i haven t used the sounds or other features yet i ll update this if anything goes out on the machine otherwise i m a very happy customer 
5 5 good
5 5 this product is a very safe concept i did try other colors and did not like them as they were too glossy for my taste i did love the white because it looks better to me it does have some of the glossy satin on the edges but is not as noticeable in the white color
5 5 my granddaughters parents loved it i haven t seen it as of yet my granddaughter nylah mae is about 6 weeks old 
4 4 good quality product purchased to make burp cloths but they can still be used as diapers if necessary 
5 3 i needed an affordable seat with a high weight limit for my toddler who i am keeping rear facing this seat fits the bill and is cute the seat is very large but it s super simple to install and fits fine in my van s second row bucket seat don t hate i have 3 booster seats in the back bench this seat however can t be very comfortable it has zero padding no styrofoam on the seat and no padding in the cover it s great for short trips or as an extra seat but i ll likely replace it soon with a more comfortable model for longer trips 
5 1 i expected the matress to be firm but this one was as hard as a rock the matress my playard came with is softer than this which isn t very comfortable in the first place will be returning and looking for another option to help our 18 month old sleep better when we travel 
5 5 these are so great i have a few and my babe just loved them they are the same binky used in the hospital 
4 5 pretty 
5 5 nice
4 1 this product seems good when your read about it but this has a problem as it hurts the baby i would prefer to use the conventional detachable cover so it does not hurt the delicate skin 
3 3 three stars for cute factor only and decently made it s basically useless otherwise wouldn t stay in babies mouth and she didnt care for it much she loves soothies but the animal pulled it out of her mouth non stop and she never really got how to push it back in 
5 5 wubbanubs are hands down my daughter s favorite pacifiers she is 3 months and she is able to grab onto the stuffed kitten and put the paci back in her mouth a task she hasn t quite mastered yet with her traditional pacifiers she was also able to grab onto the stuffed part from a pretty early age when she was a newborn i was able to swaddle in her wubba so that she didn t 34 lose it 34 the pacifier part of the wubba is an avent soothie which is approved for use with babies under 6 months i love that the wubbanub collection uses a well known and respected pacifier manufacturer since that is the part that goes in my child s mouth the stuffed animal part is similar to a beanie baby it is very soft not too big and not too heavy perfect for an infant to handle it is also important to note that the wubba s wash nicely we have the tabby kitten giraffe and red dog and all of them have been in the wash several times by now they come out nice and clean and looking like new i am sure that as my child grows and is more mobile that they will see heavier use and show some signs of aging but so far i am very please with the quality on this item and it is used daily my daughter loves them so much that i know i will not only be buying more of them for her but i will also be giving these to my expecting friends 
5 5 thus is my third little one who loves these pacifiers the flex design is awesome mimics nursing nicely 
5 5 we love wubbanubs and you cant beat how cute they are
5 5 love these 
5 5 awesome
5 5 gift
1 1 doesn t fit my crib my crib has a standard size but it doesn t fit around the exterior legs can t even use unfortunately i washed before trying on my crib so now i can t return 
5 5 love these combined with my flips 
1 1 not good material and the suction comes off after one wash and you can t put it back on 
5 5 this seat has worked great for my boy girl twins the potty shield keeps the boy from making a mess but does not stick up so high that they have a hard time getting over it i love that it has an air freshener i got refills at target 
5 5 these are great for hard wood floors 
5 3 looks fine once assembled putting it together was a struggle the lock system did not work well would ve been easier to just use screws 
5 4 a bit small very cute tho
5 5 colorful and stick well as opposed to other brands that did not 
5 5 i love this mobile the craftsmanship is fantastic each elephant is colorful without being overboard and the material is very soft it is a wind up mobile so it doesn t play continuously but that s not a drawback in my eyes my son seems engaged by the movement colors and the music when it s on my toddler daughter seems to really like it too i ve caught her reaching for the mobile on more than one occasion so it s a hit with all age ranges it seems 
5 5 natural solution
5 5 these were the first pocket diapers we bought i have nothing to compare them to besides my fst and covers i really like them they are great for my relatives to use abs gray for overnight 
5 4 this is harder to use than a similar one i had purchase overseas on a trip the tip is wider and i think that takes up too much room in his little nose to be able to inhale enough but with some effort it does the job
5 5 well received i bought for a baby shower gift it was a requested item from the mom s baby registry 
1 3 liked it while i had it but the latch opened and fell off one day somewhere in public never saw it again 
5 5 awesome
5 5 excellent adaptability for multiple sized spaces i ve been using it to close off my kitchen from the living room during cooking times so little hands can t reach the stove but i ll be repositioning it during the holidays to surround the christmas tree so little hands don t pull the tree over or break ornaments 
5 5 great product 
5 5 i put the car seat cover pad in last night it literally took 5 minutes it was very easy to install and to put the car seat in over it it will definitely protect my car from my toddler crawling in and out of the car 
5 5 arrive unharmed and well before expected date works like a charm and makes our shopping trips much easier 
5 5 i am confused with this rocking chair it shows not available then it shows being shipped on 12 10 14
5 5 cute matches bedding perfectly fast shipping 
5 5 my grandson loves his spiderman 
5 5 i bought on for each of my daughters they love thm 
5 5 very nice 
5 5 nice bibs and a good size for pre toddler 
5 5 omg my son loves this he giggles and is obsessed with it 
5 4 it s difficult to get the carseat keyfit 30 to snap in securely to the stroller other than that i love it it s just light enough i don t mind lifting it in and out of the car it rolls smoothly and folds unfolds easily 
5 5 excellent
5 5 works great with my medela glad i bought two 
5 5 such a cute bank a little small and awkward shape to store much money would be better for change not bills 
5 5 we had the newborn size and loved it so much we got the next size up when our baby outgrew the newborn size for a baby born in the colder months this is a necessity this provides the warmth needed for cold nights and the swaddle to control arms that can wake a baby our baby started sleeping 12 plus hours before 2 months old worth every penny 
5 5 just as advertised 
5 4 nice 
5 5 she loves the lights and the comfort of the seat 
5 3 had a hard time with this getting the food out my grand son had a hard time we had to keep pushing the back to help him 
5 4 although it doesn t have a hole the insmooth bottom still allows mold to grow but it added much fun to my baby s bath time a must have item for young babies 
5 2 i look forward to using this once my baby gets a bit older but it doesn t work so well with a newborn with no neck control also the giant stickers that cover the entire tub are so infuriating you would need a gallon of goo gone to get rid of them 
5 2 the replacement attachments are a single piece of plastic and do not come apart this means that if you need 2 different sizes you are sol since it s all 1 piece 
5 4 great little spoon for the diaper bag and travel the spoon feels comfortable in your hand when feeding the baby 
5 4 my daughter loves the crib 
5 5 so many compliments on this monster suit it is also very warm no coats required 
5 5 we absolutely love this high chair and so does our son it s perfect for mealtime and easy to get him in and out of it even after he is done eating he enjoys sitting in his chair and playing with his toys on the tray i would recommend this to everyone 
5 5 gift
5 5 love it works to hold up all stuff animals
4 4 does the job but they are not very absorbent and they aren t very soft 
4 4 i got this pillow to help with my hip and back pain during pregnancy i was a little disappointed in the lack of 34 firmness 34 the pillow is pretty flimsy but really still gets its job done i do enjoy the shape of it it is very nice having the support under my belly i do wish it had a removable cover to wash though 
5 3 my 3 year old can open the gate most of the time 
5 5 good quality thin light weight blanket 
4 3 these are okay but they do sink which isn t as much fun for my daughter to play with they are easy for her to hold onto and well made however 
5 4 middle is super stretchy so it doesn t hold a tiny newborn up you ll have to support their neck head the entire time so you re still bathing them with one hand my son doesn t seem to care he loves this thing he s 3 mos and has always loved baths we ve always used this with him 
1 1 i bought this as a replacement for avent 8 ounce cup since i could not find the avent 8 ounce cup anymore i bought this one as it said 8 ounce in the title but actually it is a 5 ounce cup and if you top it up to maximum possible limit it comes close to 8 ounce but there are no measurements after 5 ounce mark also it is very easy to misalign the internal spout to the lid and when that happens this leaks very badly it was a big mistake that i bought this and had i noticed these defects before i opened this i would have returned this as clearly the title is misleading 
5 3 my son fits in it perfectly but its too short for him i feel like when he touches the ground he ll outgrow the seat
5 1 some people swear by them some say it s a crock it didn t seem to make a difference on my baby 
5 4 these sheets are pretty awesome the bottom sheet is fitted which is expected but then the top sheet has fitted pockets on both corners so you don t have to do hospital corners that is absolutely a huge deal when you re dealing with a toddler bed that has rails or bars on two of the three sides down at the foot the pockets keep the top sheet right in place i want that in my california king sheets now to the drawbacks they wrinkle seriously the material is not soft i was disappointed that the top sheet is reversed they are a little too high priced i don t know how well they will hold up after multiple washing but i m hoping they are as awesome as the fitted pockets 
5 5 i got this for my daughter in who just had my grandgirl she s only had it for a few weeks and loves it what makes it extra nice is it comes with a brush the basket holds bottle nipples smaller bottles baby spoons medicine cups anything small that you wouldn t want to disappear fill it up put it in dishwasher after it s clean take out everything she puts in the basket is protected 
5 5  :)
5 5 i love it my son does toomakes it easy for him to put back in his mouth 3m easy to find anywhere great as gifts will deff buy more
5 5 this fits my 12 month old great he stays nice and warm when he sleeps and there is no worry of getting caught or twisted in blankets 
5 5 perfect
5 5 got it on time just what i wanted could ask for more 
5 5 looks just like the pictures
5 4 just what we were looking for
1 2 the product it s self works fine but my product had to be shipped twice due to the first time it supposedly ended up in a different state then once i received the product after it was shipped again it s not the color i chose 
5 5 real nice gate and just the right size 
5 5 very cute and have held up well we have had these decals up for almost a year and there has been no peeling yet we have other wall decals different brand and they are peeling already very happy with this purchase 
5 5 this is really great i had a few of the character ones and my child always complained his butt hurt once i bought this one i have had no more trouble so glad i went ahead and bought it i also do not have any trouble with it fitting sturdily on my toilet 
5 5 a very safer children seat for my 3 year old baby
5 5 my son loves these
5 4 i wish they offered organic co sleeper sheets but at this point my son was sleeping on his back so i wasn t too concerned about him sleeping face first in non organic cotton bedding 
5 5 solid caps are a must if you re traveling with the bottles we don t use formula yet but i bet you would need these to mix up formula in the bottle too as it would just get stuck in all the bottle parts and clump anyway no leaking with these caps just a pain though that i have to carry a seperate zip bag with the other bottle parts as this lid won t work with those attached 
5 5 just purchased this bed a couple month ago for our 18 month old to transition into from crib it is quite easy to assemble and takes about 20 minutes mattress from her crib fit it perfectly she just started using it and she loves it it is very easy for her to climb into at 18 months old i highly recommend for the value 
5 5 so comfortable very high quality and adorable this was the only place my son would sleep for months he preferred to sleep on his monkey mat rather than in his crib and it s portable 
5 5 quality product seemed better than the bottles that came with my pump 2 years ago quick shipping great sale 
5 5 super bien
5 5 worked well
5 5 i love the seat because it has a latch system on it also the seat is not real bulky 
5 5 purchased this as a gift for my friends one year old son item arrived much quicker than i expected exactly as listed and is a huge hit with the baby definitely recommend this product for 12months and up 
5 5 perfect sound quality
5 3 it s a little smaller than i expected my baby is 14 pounds and it s pretty tight in the shoulders much more than the regular cotton woombie 
5 4 great product that is super soft and washes well the washability is incredibly important for a changing pad cover 
5 2 these dont work as well as the brand name ones they unroll way too easily spend the extra couple bucks on the real thing 
5 5 i love not putting bleach on my baby s penis 
5 5 very nice ty in person and it fits my son very well
5 4 i really enjoy having this product and my son does too he is currently 17 months and it fits well he grew out of the medium size ones already the only con i encountered is that after normal wear for awhile there is a noticeable odor it could be because he has really sweaty feet but after a wash it smells better highly recommend using a mesh bag to protect it delicate cycle and air dry it s so easy to put on and take off especially if your on the go a lot beats putting on socks and struggling to put on shoes 
5 5 love this projector i bought it from wal mart for the list price of 12 88 and it is well worth it i don t know about younger babies but i bought this for my 9 month old daughter as she is hard to get to sleep lately even by rocking her and this thing will put her out faster than i ever could i use the music mode on low to get her sleepy then when that gets her sleepy i switch it over to nature sounds pros my daughter loves it it sings a little as well as plays music and nature sounds the rotating bears projection is super cute it s cheap and easily affordable can keep the volume on lowest setting if switch it automatically from music to nature sounds without turning it off first it resets if turn it to off position before changing it if turns offer on its own it stays on the sound setting you put it on has button on front so your baby can turn it back on if you are asleep and he or she wakes up and wants music cons the strap is super hard to figure out if don t read the instructions you have to double loop it for it to catch in the holes and stay it is loud even on the lowest setting but my daughter doesn t mind it as long as i switch it to nature sounds when she starts falling asleep the batteries do wear out fast that it comes with mine lasted a week after i bought it i freaked out to as when the batteries get low the projection will refuse to stay on but the music and sound still work leading to you automatically thinking it broke when you just need new batteries it takes 3 aa batteries and i suggest getting the rechargeable kind so won t have to keep running to the store the image when you first buy it appears blurry mine did try changing the batteries the picture got a lot clearer and the sound less wobbly after put in some new energizers overall this projector has exceeded my expectations and gives me some free time as it does the singing and entertaining before nap or bedtime for me glad invested the money just don t know why amazon is selling it so high me and baby girl love it tertaining before nap or bedtime for me glad invested the money just don t know why amazon is selling it so high me and baby girl love it 
5 1 it s just a acceptable built product 
5 4 my 7month old loves this 
4 4 the side cracked after just a few months use and we had to use duct tape on it but it still works the stroller was not misused in anyway whatsoever so the only thing we can figure is the folding and unfolding caused the crack 
5 5 good item fast delivery
5 5 i bought this bed for my daughter when she was 18mo she is now 3 and still using it she loves to jump on the bed despite me telling her not to and this has stood up to it like a champ i put it together by myself while i was pregnant with twins no problems at all now that the twins are getting big i ordered another one and the oldest will hand hers down so she can get a big girl bed and the twins will have matching toddler beds honestly the 3 year old could probably use this toddler bed for at least another year or two if she were not handing it down to one if the twins 
5 5 my little granddaughter just loves this walker i chose this one because she is little for her age and i read a review that said it was a bit short for most babies it fits her perfectly it s sturdy was easy to put together easy to clean and folds up easily for transport the only thing i noticed was the wheels don t work easily when going backwards 
5 5 i had originally purchased and used another tub for my infant son once he got to about 3 months old the other tub was awkward and uncomfortable and he hated bath time this tub is great the slight recline on the reclining infant side is perfect and he doesn t slide around i like that the plastic seat has no hard angular edges so it s much more comfortable 
4 1 these work my two year old still can t open these the only reason i m not giving five stars is because they don t come in all white update from 4 to 1 star four years and two kids later i m attempting to remove these this has been such an arduous process that i m starting to wonder if it was worth it having children at all a complete kitchen renovation might be easier than removing 16 of these sticky things that have cemented onto my kitchen and bathroom cabinets some reviewers spoke of removal tabs and easy to remove but i have not been so lucky my cabinets are never going to be the same buyer beware 
4 4 everything is great 4 stars because i wish it had some kind of music 
5 5 my infant son loves this little thing the exterior fabric is the same material used on many running shoes so it s not plush at all the ears make that crakling sound that babies seem to love i thought that was interesting 
5 4 great mat though quite large make sure you have enough room for it 
5 5 we ve only had these a short while but we ve had no problems so far they seem very well made and have worked well for us my three year old has issues with noise so i got them for him to wear in the car when his baby sister cries we can still talk to each other but they do a great job muffling her cries 
5 5 perfect bedding and perfect price 
5 5 so easy to link to your main unit great quality no issues whatsoever between switching back and forth with our two cameras 
5 5 this was an awesome product my daughter in law loves having it keep the baby warm my son loves it because when he carries the seat his hand has room to move without having fabric move around my granddaughter loves looking at the black and white design when we reverse this cover very nicely made shipment was quick we all love this prodcut 
5 5 bought this as a baby shower gift my niece now has twin boys and loves the monitor it works great the clarity is very good highly recommend this item 
5 5 i feel safer having it on the faucet since once my granddaughter slipped in the tub and hit the faucet and busted her lip awesome transaction
5 4 good quality sturdy i should have measured first i expected larger with a name like jumbo definitely worth the price 
5 5 great product and was needed for all my baby bottles for daycare 
4 4 i only gave this chair 4 stars because the stitching is coming apart and we have hardly used it i need to try to find some warranty information to see if i can return it or get it replaced other than than i love it i haven t had to wash it yet but it has been very convenient the few times i used it 
1 1 the kit consists of old dried out clay that cracks as it dries even though i kept covered with damp paper towel as the kit suggests a straw to make a hole a dowel rod 34 rolling pin 34 and a circle cookie cutter that leaves ugly edges what a waste of time and money these were for my one month old baby s feet and hand prints and they came out looking cracked and of poor quality don t waste your money you would have better luck making your own dough mixture 
5 5 quality design at it s best there is no question why it is super popular at every baby shower 
5 5 this thing is ridiculously cute and so soft the size is great for it s intended recipient a niece that s turning three soon it seems pretty well made too i m honestly tempted to buy one for myself 
5 5 the only paci my baby will accept i have tried avent and nuby and she wont like them 
5 5 daughter loves then no other pacifier compares 
1 1 not the print as shown on the picture
5 5 cute my son loves it i didn t get it for him until he was 9 months old but he still enjoys it it keeps the pacifier from bouncing all over the place we have many soothie pacifiers and can never find them when they have fallen because they bounce under things 
5 5 excellent product and the shipping was very fast very satisfied 
5 5 love the material 
5 5 my grandson logan couldn t be without it
5 5 really fun game to play got a laugh out of the group trying to stick the dummy on babies face pretty cheaply made but good for a fun game at the baby shower 
5 5 can t wait for my grand daughter to get her little hands on this one she has most of them but laid them out for all of us to see she s a nut 
2 2 baby wouldn t take any pacifier other than the soothee this one was too slippery plastic for sure not matte finish like the soothe and kept sliding around his mouth the flex action was also annoying because if you put your finger in the hole you could push it too far down his throat which we only did once before we learned our lesson 
3 3 wubbanubs are really neat products they re cute easy to find in the dark and weigh down the pacifier enough so baby can t spit it halfway across the room now that our baby s four months old if he loses the pacifier he can just grab the little plush and return it to his mouth however cleaning the pacifier is a huge issue the tag claims the whole thing can just be thrown in the washer that works great for the plush but not for the pacifier even though i made sure to clean the pacifier thoroughly afterwards the baby gagged and kept spitting it out until i d washed it a few more times i guess there was still detergent or something clinging to it and boiling the pacifier is a pain you can t drop the plush toy into the boiling water so you have to stand over the pot and just hold it for five minutes also the last time i did that i think i held it a little too close because the plush caught fire oops don t get me wrong this is a really cute product and makes an awesome shower gift but it would be much less hassle if you could switch out pacifiers 
3 3 it serves its purpose i guess my son just didn t want to continue to use a pacifier 
5 2 product came so late i needed for baby shower and it came after baby was born lol
5 5 even cuter in person love wubbanub 
1 1 this item fell apart within 1 week of having it the diaper changing bag is nice and study but this is cheap and poorly constructed 
4 2 my son had absolutely no interest in this pacifier i love penguins and i love the thought of having a pacifier that closes when it falls to keep it clean but given my son won t use it i am giving it 2 stars based upon the product in theory playing around with it it does generally close when i drop it it appears very bulky and uncomfortable in terms of being used by a baby as a pacifier the shell that closes over it makes it bulky and unappealing i would imagine for a baby to use all in all super cute but i don t recommend 
5 5 this made a great gag gift to a raiders fan the quality and price met expectations 
4 4 if you have a kid who likes pacifiers then you must know that a good pacifier is a lifesaver these wubanubs are my child s best friends i have two on hand we lost one tragically in the great mall incident of 2014 backtracked through the entire mall in a desperate search to find the lion wubanub we had for newborns they provide a small weight so it doesn t pop out of the mouth as the kid gets older it s something to hold onto while they suck away to their heart s content the only problem they have is that they re not very easy to wash but i m sure there s some reason for the pacifier not being detachable and that reason is that if it were detachable then people would attach it to their own little plush dolls instead of buying more wubanubs 
5 5 my daughter s first and favorite pacifier 
5 5 love these baby s face stays much drier and she can pick up easily 7 mo 
5 5 i had the nuk soft orthodontic binkies for my daughter when she was a newborn they don t make them for older children over 6 months though so i searched for all silicone pacifiers and found these the big ring is a bit awkward at first but it makes it easy to put on loveys etc they also don t leave marks on my child s face i clean them every day just with soap and water and put them in one of my mam bottles while sterilizing them easy as pie will get more 
5 5 my child loves these and takes them everywhere :)
5 5 my son loves his wubba i read some reviews about washing paci holder it s not difficult i just threw it in washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry then i washed paci in sink with dish soap problem solved good as new 
5 4 seems to be a nice quality product my son never did take to using a pacifier but he has played with them a few times 
5 5 awesome fit for my son i loved it 
5 1 you have to really struggle to open the container completely un usable 
5 5 i never knew what a wubbanub was until my friend asked me why my 3 month old didn t have one i went online that night and ordered two the package arrived promptly and my daughter loves them they are nice because as your baby develops her fine motor skills she is able to learn how to put the soothie in her mouth herself great buy 
5 5 the only ones my boys took every baby is different so i can t rate based on that personally though these pacifiers saved my sanity i spent a lot on pacifiers tried different brands these were the ones but they are so much cheaper in stores burlington less than half the price so now how do i get my 2 year old off of them 
5 4 we love wubba nubs such a great invention we prefer the puppy monkey frog though the giraffe has a scrawny neck isn t as stable 
5 5 never lose a binky again these are great and machine washable and air dry quickly 
5 4 my son loves his wubbanubs i just wish they did not have the little beans in the feet as this could be a choking hazard anyway the reindeer is cute and festive i would love to see them make a snowman too 
5 5 bub isn t much into pacifiers it seems but he definitely takes this better than the round natursutten that hits his nose i like this one is natural rubber and is made in one piece not joined like some other rubber pacifiers the hook fits nicely on your finger without slipping when you haven t got anywhere to pop it down straight away 
5 5 this was one of the best items i bought when i had a newborn
5 5 my son loves it we named it monkey and monkey goes everywhere my son goes it s also very easy to find
5 5 you can do no wrong with the billy bob gag pacifiers i bought one with 2 huge bucked teeth in the front and they were hilarious the grillz are for a girl and her father loved it the baby will not really use it as a pacifier normal wear and tear but when they approach their lunch or whatever friends it is going to be a hoot 
5 5 we haven t tried the monkey yet but we have the giraffe and my son loves it even at a month old he wrapped his little arms around it while sucking it washes well too
4 5 my baby was in love with her wubbanubs from first sight the only 34 problem 34 is that it s been hard to try and transition her to other pacifiers now that she s older i wish the animal was detachable and could be switched out to other styles of pacifiers it does lose its plumpness after a few months but nothing has become unstitched they say to switch out after a few months but the pacifier shows no wear and tear and can be cleaned so there hasn t been a need to buy a replacement 
5 5 i love it 
5 5 fit my graco pack n play perfect lil pricey but be sure you measure your playpen
5 5 this protectors seem to be working well and keeping our baby safe from sharp corners in our house so far we have covered all around the corners and sides of our end stands and along sharp parts on the wall very happy with the thickness and quality of the product as well as how much you get for the price the 3m tape works well to get the cushions to stick to the furniture and they provide more than enough for how much cushioning you are given 
5 5 the bright starts 3 in 1 roaring fun lion is a great toy for babies through toddler age kids its strength is its versatility permitting play by sitting in front of it pushing it from behind or sitting riding on it it also adjusts very simply between the three modes due to the solid fit and construction of the whole unit babies can press the lion s nose to trigger music and sound effects while the included ping pong balls spin around its face they can also 34 feed 34 it the balls and then watch them come out below for some cause and effect play older kids can push or ride on it and watch the balls spin around as they do so overall the 3 in 1 roaring fun lion provides a variety of play modes in one package while also ensuring that it will get use as your baby grows into his her toddler years it s a lot of fun that s also a good value 
3 2 i haven t yet used the product but want to point out something that is not in the pictures we registered for this product because according to the pictures it didn t have any logos or pictures or cutesy animals on it it does there is a bear face on the hood part of the towel if you re looking for a neutral towel this is not your choice this was mis represented as a logo picture free towel 
5 5 this is the best high chair for little spaces and works great at restaurants and to carry around 
5 5 great 
5 5 these pouches are great so easy to fill and clean my daughter thinks it is so fun to fill them with our own homemade purees 
5 4 this is great i put it under her high chair and it collects the food she drops i rinse it in the sink after each meal and hang it up only thing is it is a bit bigger than necessary which makes it a little awkward to rinse in the sink but generally it s great 
1 5 these were the only bottles our breastfed daughter would use when i went back to work at 12 weeks i purchased them on recommendation of our daycare and have not been disappointed 
5 4 good harness my 2 year old grandson didn t like it when we took him to mexico it was helpful in the airport and in between layovers to give him a chance to walk run around at his pace it took me awhile to figure out the straps as the directions were lacking but i was able to find a youtube instruction page that helped a lot 
5 3 for an inexpensive bowl and spoon set they get the job done the bowls are very lightweight and the perfect size for small appetites my 2 5 year old loves choosing which color she wants to use and i feed my 8 month old from these as well we bought them for using during travel so i do like that they nest and are so lightweight the spoons handles are easy to grip for my toddler as she feeds herself and for my husband and me as we feed the baby the shape of the end of the spoon that holds food is nice it s not too shallow so i can serve thin purees or soups and it s not so deep that my kids can t get their food out of the bottom the one drawback about the spoons is that the end that holds the food has melted on three of them the only thing we can figure is that the water in the dishwasher gets too hot we can t come up with any other option but our water heater isn t even set very high so it is surprising to us we have tossed the three spoons with the melted tips 
5 5 it was everything that i wanted for my granddaughter i d looked in local stores and couldn t find this lamp to complete her frozen bedroom so one little girl will be thrilled come christmas 
5 5 great quality 
5 5 this is absolutely the best diffuser ever it is so easy to use it works seamlessly the fun color changes are a unique and creative addition to the unit and it just looks cool super easy to maintain diffuses essential oils perfectly without destroying their natural properties literally i have purchased 5 of these units 1 for work 2 for my home and 2 to give as gifts for christmas my patients at work all want to know what it is and remark what beautiful scents it produces i almost always use lavender at work to calm the crazy when amazon temporarily sold out of these diffusers i contacted deneve directly and they were great about telling me when more came in stock super happy with this item 
5 5 this robe is adorable it is soft and perfect for when my little ones get out of the bath they love to be warm right after the bath so this robe is great and he looks like a little ferocious lion it s great the material is really soft doesn t get all matted from being wet and really durable 
5 5 product arrived quickly it was really easy to install it sticks very well highly recommend 
5 5 this has been one of the best baby product purchases we have made so far we have hard wood floors and needed a soft surface for our baby to crawl roll and walk on this is perfect it is very big and covers a large play area the mat is brightly colored and the playful pictures keep our baby engaged he had multiple falls on this mat as he learned to walk and he would get up unaffected the mat is not super thick but it is very dense and will protect them from bumps and bruises 
5 5 this one is perfect for storage baby food you make easy to store and easy to remove and it s deep and can store lots of food 
5 4 it s nice stroller i like it and worth it s prize i recommend it
1 2 i have had this monitor for 8 months and although i love the quality and features i am very unhappy with it recently it all of a sudden doesn t hold a charge and i have made several attempts to fix it it is rendered useless and i m monitorless i recently just email the company and waiting on feedback i hope there is something they can do because back in april i spent 140 00 on this monitor and did not expect it to last less then a year 
5 5 worked just as expected 
5 4 i use them a lot freezer and microwave okay
5 5 very cool product that adds a lot of safety for kids when bathing fit like a charm on our bath spout 
5 5 always a favorite go to for a new baby gift 
5 4 this product is awesome it totally saved me on the 3 hour plane ride and when we were just going store to store where a stroller was too big for my daughter loves it she actually cuddles up next to me and goes to sleep every time she s in it only complaints are can t wear it for too long and its some times a challenge to get her in it just right 
3 4 works ok
5 4 my daughter loves this she is perfectly potty trained but still fears falling in who doesn t she moves it onto the toilet by herself with no problem it is waterproof enough to wash in the shower 
5 5 i have a number of portable diaper changing pads like this one is a padded neoprene and many are just simple fabric with a water repelling side however i have to say that this is the softest and most luxurious diaper changing pad i own i have the vibrant dinosaur print which i absolutely love even though i m usually a black and gray sort of person the fabric is a very soft sleek plush and for once i don t feel guilty laying my baby down on it honestly the thing is nice enough that you could use it as a little car seat blanket in a pinch it is that soft and the fabric is that high quality it did go through the washer well when we got some food smudged on it in the food released from the fabric easily no stains i received a sample of this diaper pad in exchange for my honest review this thing is nice enough that i actually plan on purchasing a few more for my next baby 
5 5 i went back and forth on this purchase because of the price but i couldn t be happier with it beautiful art and perfect for the nursery 
5 4 haven t used it yet but the mattress looks nice upon arrival both of our beds are simmons and when it comes to our kid my husband and i thought it should be a reliable choice 
5 4 i love this stuffed toyit s really soft
4 4 decent spoons perform spoon y functions the bowl of the spoon is shallow enough that my infant daughter can get all the food off we have had issues with some other smaller spoons that are deeper she can t really remove all the food yet unfortunately these spoons are a bit long for self feeding yet the smaller spoons are too deep we need to find a brand that combines both i guess i don t find the 34 resting 34 edge to work all that well they tip sometimes also for some reason the blue spoon is staining but the others are not 
5 5 happy 
5 5 nice for the price 
5 5 great to have found some since that is what the grand baby loves 
5 1 it s to much work to clean
5 5 perfect for recovery from lumbar surger 
5 5 my 18 month old grandson loves it 
5 5 i love this very easy to use would definite recommend 
5 5 i must admit i was expecting a low quality product that was durable enough to last a few months but imagine my surprise that the product was not only beyond my quality expectations but absolutely beautiful this product is made 10x better than most american products 
5 5 love this diffuser i have tried several including doterra and quooz lull and this is by far my favorite i now own 4 one for each of my family members bedrooms and one in my family room 30x20 this diffuser will scent all of these rooms nicely and it is very quiet this is the diffuser i recommend to anyone wanting an excellent diffuser at a reasonable price 
3 1 did not work for me wrinkles and peeling and pain in the neck
5 5 my son loves this pacifier and i love being able to find it in his car seat when it comes out of his mouth my only small problem is that he likes to pull it out 
5 5 i honestly don t know how i made it through my first two kids without one of these they are great for so many reasons 1 they are easy to find and don t get lost i have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens i had gone through with my other two kids by the same time saving as well they are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car 2 my baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth months earlier than my others did since it is so much bigger much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth 3 it stays in place this is the kicker for me especially as a newborn before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in when they spit out their bink half way it doesn t fall out completely less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth 4 although this is just anticipation when it s time to wean off of the binky i think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to after 5 months of constant use our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal honestly this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time if i only need one binky every 5 6 months i m one happy mama 
5 5 we bought this for our son s family it is a vemry good conversation piece and it makes you laugh and that makes the baby laugh this would work great for thank you cards with the baby picture imagine that lol
5 5 our baby loves this she had it since she was about 6 months old and it s only for naptime and bedtimes they are super soft and very cute she knows it s time for bed when we give her the wubbie best part is that she can find them easily in the crib and self soothe to back to sleep it s now part of our go to gift when any of our friends have a new baby i haven t tried washing the whole thing but will wash the soothie with baby dish soap and water if it gets dropped somewhere untoward 
5 5 loved it 
5 5 these work perfect
1 2 useless thing very flimsy and uncomfortable to use when you have a baby crying falls off the stroller opens easily 
5 3 nice but better and cheaper to buy pacifiers with its own cover
5 5 love it had the whole family cracking up 
5 5 adorable 
1 3 they give me other colors :(
5 5 so cute 
5 5 perfect for my baby who s 6 mo old 
5 5 good purchase
5 5 my daughter loves these great quality for a great price
5 4 funny
5 5 we have about 5 different types of pacifiers and this ended up the only one being used because we can actually find it unlike the other dozen that end up underneath blankets and in between cushions at two months the baby has started to hold onto the arms and legs of the monkey and play with it happy to be able to grab something we ll probably get another one as a back up i d put the wubbanub a requirement to purchase prepping for a baby s arrival 
5 5 we love avent pacifiers great price and fast shipping 
5 5 i m in my mid 30 s everyone around me is having babies i ve given one of these to at least 10 new mothers and they all love them i m actually tagged in several photos of babies sucking on these adorable wubbanubs i can often find one that pairs with any nursery theme great for little hands to hold onto easy to find and the paci is the same as the one they give at all the local hospitals something about that rubber and size makes it irresistible for newbies buy a bunch to have on hand throw on top of a gift it s a special little bonus gift not many mamas tend to know about they ll love it 
5 5 my son will only take this pacifier lol i lost the first one and had to buy the exact one asap i also love the fact that he can find it easily at night he grabs it and places it right in his mouth he s not able to do that with a regular pacifier this pacifier is a bit pricy but worth it at the end 
2 2 the snap comes open very easily so it is easy to lose it fell off of my diaper bag about 4 times that i noticed and then the 5th time i don t know where it fell off i only had it for about 3 weeks before i lost it 
5 5 my daughter will only use this brand and style of binky the glow in the dark is very useful when she drops it at night i believe these are the best pacifiers out there 
1 5 i hate to write a negative review but this is a matter of safety the grip bath handle does not stick to the wall wet or dry for more than 5 minutes i was dependent on its use and lucky i had someone nearby to help me out of the tub i used it to get in the tub and after a few minutes it just fell off maybe the one sent me is defective but i certainly can t use it 
3 3 i generally like this pack n play i really love the vance pattern this is easy to set up and take down and i don t have a hard time remembering how to do it when it s been a long time since i last moved it the bassinet is very comfortable however the umbrella over the bassinet does not work well it neither attaches well nor can it move when it s attached it easily falls down on baby i was never able to get the diaper changing station to attach unless i wanted to do damage to the crib s fabric but i never needed the changing station so i didn t miss it it is nice having storage on the side of the pack n play but the shelves have no support and cannot hold heavy items we tend to only place light items on the shelves such as socks hats and mittens i would have chosen a different pack n play just to get better storage 
2 2 nothing on the tray to keep the bottles up smells like something is burning while it steams 
5 4 the box was big enough to hold all my son s thomas trains the top of the box could have been better for closing in all the box is perfect to keep all his trains in one place 
5 5 big enough to put all my daughter s plush toys so cute 
4 4 a little expensive but fit my medelas for day care 
5 5 as described 
5 5 this is so soft i love this blanket it s a must have 
3 1 the bear was cute but his fuzzy hair came off on my grandsons hands not good since everything goes into his mouth we were hoping the womb sounds would comfort and relax my grandson so he would sleep better but it didn t seem to make a difference to him disappointed to say the least 
2 2 the product itself is wonderful but it came damaged i was so disappointed as it was a baby shower gift
5 5 this product is the best or should i say 34 brest 34 i recommend bringing it to the hospital with you to help in those first feedings i have used it every day since my baby came home he is now three months old ;)
5 5 good
5 5 this truly is a luxury backseat mirror for the baby very high quality much better than the last one we had bought 
5 5 we bought this for ease of travel rather than bringing our full size car seat for our 4 year old it is lightweight and easy to carry and store very simple to install when taking a cab or uber for airline travel it would fit under most airline seats and it fit easily in the overhead on a jetblue e190 where roll aboards need to go in sideways this fit perfectly in the space after two roll aboards were loaded above 
5 5 the best breast pads ever 
5 5 love it for kids bathtub toys out of the way and keeps everthing tidy delivery was quick and the quality is good for being a plastic product 
5 5 great product 
5 5 i bought this for my husband because he loves to grill and i thought this might keep him from burning his hands taking things of the grill he used it the first day we got it and he loves it they are thick and are non slip we even use it in the house so it is easier to remove stuff from the oven we will be ordering some more of these and have recommended them to family and friends 
5 1 this was a very disappointing purchase the swaddle material is way too flexible it allowed my 10 lb 6 week old baby to maneuver his way out of it that should not happen with a baby this tiny and with such unintentional immature movements so getting past that the 34 weights 34 sewn in bean bags like the little ones you toss are awkwardly placed i think if they would place velcro on the inside and some velcro on a couple bean bags it would work better when you finally stretch out this material and get baby all wrapped up you ll find the weights are in weirdo spots it was a poor investment on a positive note i did buy a different wrap the alden anais 34 easy swaddle blanket 34 perfect swaddle with a perfect fit to sweeten the deal a little more it s less expensive 
5 5 very cute
5 5 these work great for my baby the two larger bottles come with size two nipples instead of size one so order extra size one nipples if you want to use them 
5 5 our son loves it 
5 5 the owl nub is a litte bigger sturdier than the other ones and it holds better plus it s super cute my daughter loves this 
5 5 not the same material as the ones we got in the hospital but my lo will take them over any other paci 
5 5 love the color
5 5 love these glow is just enough to help him or us find it in the wee hours of the night 
5 5 fino
5 5 my son s favorite wubby 
5 3 i only like the clear ones because they re the least obvious but the colored ones make him look like he s got a giant red thing or blue thing in his mouth kind of a dumb look 
5 4 cute easy for baby to hold pacifier seemed a little hard
5 5 our son loves these 
5 5 would never buy any other name in nipples or pacifiers they are strong orthodontically correct and clean up easily 
3 4 works well for my baby although the colors i got are not the same as the image a pink pacifier for my boy 
5 5 very convenient for newborns who aren t able to hold the pacifier in themselves my daughter has down syndrome which tends to be associated with low muscle tone making it a little more challenging to maintain her hold on the pacifiers this was really helpful in keeping the pacifier in for her which also led to her muscle tone improving thanks to basically working out her muscles by sucking on the pacifier it was very handy in the nicu by holding the pacifier in for her when someone wasn t able to physically pop it back in her mouth it s also been convenient in her car seat when i am not able to help hold her pacifier for her 
1 1 its not the same color it came in red color
5 5 excelent
5 5 wonderfull
5 5 great 
5 5 really very good 
5 5 baby likes them
5 5 easy for my baby 
5 4 love this product so much that it is now my go to gift for 34 new moms 34 
5 5 so cute and funny
5 5 very handy 
5 5 my oldest loves her ellie and hoping the new baby does too provides comfort and security in such a small toy 
5 5 my 4 month old loves this pacifier we started out with just a frog wubbanub but needed another for when we needed to clean the frog my daughter loves to take the bunny out of her mouth to look at it and then put it back in her mouth she loves to chew on the bunnies ears :)
5 1 my baby girl had a hard time finding a pacifier that she liked besides using me as a pacifier i saw great reviews for this product so tried it out definitely a hard nipple and still at 3 months old she doesn t like it it is a shorter pacifier than normal so she doesn t gag but she doesn t like how hard it is 
5 5 we love that these are bpa free and they are a great size for young babies very flexible and soft which is awesome they will not hurt baby waldner when we rolls on top of them i love that the handle is stationary and not flip down baby can always grab it easily 
5 5 baby likes them they are not vanilla scented like the ones she loved in the hospital but she still likes them the same 
5 5 my baby love it 
5 5 we purchased this pacifier and the brown monkey pacifier for my son along with other plain phillips avent soothie pacifiers the wubbanubs were by far my son s favorites especially the puppy he even had a name for it but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments we live overseas so you don t see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them before buying this item i wasn t sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs the plain avent soothies but i think it is well worth the extra money even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them and some of the plain pacifiers with the brown monkey another brown puppy and the turtle we purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things 
5 5 cute reindeer granddaughter loves all her wubbanubs and will not only suck on the pacifer but she also chews on the stuffed animal just wish wubbanubs weren t so expensive 
5 5 this is our son s favorite pacifier we ve tried them all he has a synthetic allergy so we do all natural products this is a hit we ve tried all of the pacifiers out there these win 
4 3 really cute binkey however my daughter only used it for about a week after birth and then would spit it out ended up loving the mams pacifier instead 
4 4 funny gag gift actual usability is questionable the size is really big but the nipple part doesn t go out very far 
5 5 i purchased two for my diaper bag and dads cute way to keep up with baby s paci s 
5 5 love it 
5 5 kitty pacifier is the best my 10 month old gives it 5 stars 
5 5 if your child loves their pacifier then this is a must have item i have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier most of the items i have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference one thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier she is a big pacifier baby i learned quickly that even though young babies can t control their movements and can t throw things a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again wubbanubs actually solve this problem when a pacifier falls it can t go far if it is thrown it is easily found and when babies start being able to control their hands they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier 
5 5 it s 3am it s been an hour since the baby ate last and you have finally slipped into rem sleep beautiful sleep you start to dream and bam the baby lets out a cry and you look at the clock letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby the baby is still asleep but that won t last long if you can t locate the pacifier thank goodness you thought to buy a mam night glow pacifier instead blindly feeling around the bed then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time you spot the pacifier immediately pop it into baby s mouth and he she makes that classic maggie simpson sucking noise silently you tip toe back to bed and hope it lasts bottom line even if it s been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms i only buy the glow in the dark pacifiers now unlike many other pacifiers mam pacifiers can be put in two ways there is no 34 right side 34 up this makes giving it to baby in the middle of the night that much easier i love mam and will continue to buy these for my babies 
5 5 love it fast delivery 
3 3 these were recommended to me by a few friends of mine and since my daughter didn t take any pacifiers i was hoping she would take these however she didn t and these are just laying around hopefully will be different for your little one but didn t work for us she ended up loving the mams pacifiers instead 
5 5 perfect for seahawk fan baby the colors are perfect 
5 4 they are great but they were all black no blue stipres on them 
5 4 i ve bought two of these for a friend s baby she grew to love it around 6months once she could control her grip on his feet without accidentally ripping it out of her mouth and it became like a comfort blanket she couldn t sleep without 34 normy 34 and we had to replace it promptly with a new one when my dog ate him having the elephant attached made it easier to find than normal binkies which have a way of getting lost in every corner of your car and couch the only improvement i would suggest is to have a snap closure strap between the binky and the stuffed animal so it can be washed easier when the fabric becomes too grungy 
5 5 it meets my granddaughters expectation 
5 5 good 
5 5 good 
5 5 excelent
3 3 the soothie pacifier was difficult for my baby to keep in his mouth however he did get attached to the stuffed animal and will now occasionally use it pacifier legs and ears as a teether 
5 5 my son loves the pacifiers 
5 5 we purchased this pacifier and the brown puppy pacifier for my son along with other plain phillips avent soothie pacifiers the wubbanubs were by far my son s favorites especially the puppy he even had a name for it but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments we live overseas so you don t see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them before buying this item i wasn t sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs the plain avent soothies but i think it is well worth the extra money even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them and some of the plain pacifiers with the brown monkey another brown puppy and the turtle we purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things one other note when we weened our son off of his pacifiers we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it it s cuter than it sounds to replace his monkey pacifier did going from the monkey pacifier to the monkey blanket make that transition easier i don t know it seemed to us like it did but it s just a single data point 
5 5 great baby shower gift 
5 5 very goog
3 4 i know it says colors vary wish there was a way to indicate boy girl neutral colors i thought maybe there would be a gender neutral color in the pack but i got pink and purple and i have a boy but its fine he can still use them 
5 5 my baby loves these 
5 5 came just as expected with no problems baby will be a 49ers fan 
5 5 verygood
5 5 the only binkey my baby will take worth the 
5 1 we just opened this item tonight and we are on the couch and our baby is chewing on the arm of her new pacifier monkey doll it was too late when we notice she was chewing on the hand and when we took the pacifier doll off her she is chewing on something then swallowed something when we looked on the doll s hand it has a hole in it the beads inside falls out easily legal complain will suffice on our part thank you other child could have it worst because of this item 
5 5 perfect exactly as advertised 
5 3 works great the visability goes from clear with color to a little fuzzy and black and white but all and all we are able to see and hear and that s what we got it for good buy for the cost 
5 5 great bibs and they wash well
5 2 we ve tried twice to help our baby pass gas with this and had better luck helping her spread her little tush and the windi seemed to make our upset baby more upset but it seems to help others when you re baby is gassy colicky you want to try anything so i wouldn t dismiss this product as it appears to work for some i just want to help set expectations and share it wasn t a source of relief for our little one good luck 
1 2 the suckers sucked sorry it doesn t stick i got what i payed for 
5 5 love the music and the colors great learning for babies
5 5 i use this snug for my orbit baby g3 carseat fit perfectly and baby sleep good 
5 5 a life saver my first daughter has a death suction and was taking chunks off me and i felt like a bad person because i cried over the idea of feeding her she always wants something un her mouth but i didn t want to give her a pacifier because it might interfere with feeding the shields solved both since i ve been using them i have had little to no pain feeding and can give her a pacifier happy mom happy baby
5 5 i had a lot of back pain carrying my son and had to limit our time together because of that my first carrier chico would not hold him well and i didn t feel comfortable with it the babybjorn miracle is wonderful he feels very comfortable on it even for long periods of time my back is protected and the weight is distributed i can hold him for over an hour 
5 5 read previous reviews and was not sure about the product ordered and the stickers work great placed on clean flat painted wall with limited handling of stickers and used wall paper squeegee after placement it is bright and cheerful perfect for the nursery 
5 1 these were nothin like the ones given in the hospital they were different in design and the nipple is a lot stiffer my son noticed the difference right away and will not use these veryy unhappy with this purchase 
5 5 wish there is hanger to hang to the baby
5 4 we used this for our 6 month old for about a year we used it to transition to binky only at bedtime 34 monkey is in bed and waiting for you 34 our sone would get excited to go to bed with his monkey also when we decided it was time for the binky to go we just cut off the end and he kept monkey put in washer many times set out to dry i am only giving 4 stars because the binky is more for newborns which you aren t supposed to put things in bed with them for sids i wish this came with bunnies for older children there are others on the market that you can add your own binky but our son would always take them out of the animal 
5 5 has lasted forever 
5 5 perfect for the baby on board 
5 5 it s so cute 
5 5 baby loves 
5 5 great quality
5 5 my daughter loves these it s too bad they are so hard to find 
5 5 the specified were above my expectations
5 4 good
5 5 good
5 5 love these 
5 5 it so far is great 
5 4 great
5 5 good
5 5 great seller a 
5 4 our little guy loves these pacifiers and the glow in the dark feature is surprisingly helpful
5 4 super cute but the back leg came off the first time i washed it 
3 3 it s really cute but the lips are a bright red and i was kind of weirded out because when i opened the packaging it was mailed in the pacifier wasn t in its own wrapping was just kind of bizarre
3 3 i am a little disappointed in this cute puppy wubbanub it is a dirty gray color not at all appealing to look at it looks as if it s been on the floor and dirtied up the wubbanub concept is very good though i d recommend a different one though 
5 1 way to small for my newborns mouth would go far enough in she kept spitting it out and couldn t latch 
5 5 best thing ever keeps pacifier in place even when baby wearing hate that i did not discover this until child 3 
5 4 after trying almost every pacifier on the market for my grandson who has a tongue tie we have finally found success these pacifiers have quite a small flat teat which does not interfere with his natural mouth movement 
5 5 not too much to say but these are the only pacifiers our 7 month old will take good price
5 5 these are great for older babies and good for teething my son loves them 
5 5 i ve had one of these with all 3 of my kids and i love them they re perfect for keeping track of all the milestones and changes 
5 5 my daughter loved playing this music box 
5 5 great for my baby nice and soft 
5 5 swaddling with just a blanket or sheet was becoming so tedious and our little girl was able to kick her way out of it this product is awesome it simplifies the whole process and keeps our bundle of joy comfy and cozy 
5 5 the best bath chair ever 
5 5 thank you
5 5 supportive and it prevents my daughter s neck from moving back and forth while she s sleeping i love the fact it s completely smooth one side and soft and furry on the other my daughter prefers the smooth side overall we are very pleased with this purchase 
5 4 love the bassinet feature it is sturdy the mesh frame is safe for babies it s very easy to wheel around the room as well taking one star out because the 34 napper changer 34 attachment on top is really useless you can t use that if you want to use this as a bassinet besides the attachment is too small to hold a growing baby bad i dint understand why you would want the child to nap in the tiny mapper when he can nap in the sturdier bassinet why would you change on the 34 changer 34 and risk soiling the whole thing especially if you have a boy 
1 1 wasn t as it is shown in the picture
5 4 love this but i ve had it for a few months and the shoulder pad on the strap is ripped
5 5 works great 
5 5 i am very pleased with this product it definitely makes me feel more comfortable with our little one following us around in the kitchen it prevents him from grabbing the pan pot handles and possibly dumping their hot contents onto himself it keeps his hand out of the fire it also keeps what we are cooking out of his line of sight so he isn t as interested i also like that it does warm up enough to warn him that he shouldn t be messing around with it but not enough to hurt him the installation is very easy i did have to pull our stove oven away from the wall to fit the velcro attachments but it was a breeze otherwisemy only complaint with this purchase was the lack of prime shipping options i m definitely spoiled by amazon now i almost didn t buy it specifically because of the 10 to shipping which increases the cost of this item by 1 3 i m sure they are losing a significant amount of sales due to this it also took 9 days to arrive which seems absurd now that amazon has conditioned me to think 2 day shipping should be free aside from the shipping cost experience the product itself is wonderful 
5 5 our daughter loves her swing the canopy is a bit bothersome so we don t use it but otherwise the swing is comfortable and well made plus it is made in the usa grandma my mother with hand issues does have some trouble managing the release mechanism 
4 1 this solar light only worked for about a week i even changed the battery in it and it still didn t work again it s pretty and when the wind blows it twirls which is nice but i wanted a solar light so i don t recommend this product 
5 5 i ve been using it for about 2 months its almost completely silent and produces a good thick stream of moisture i like to have it mist into my face while working on computer to help with dry eyes 
5 5 i switched to this pump from the medela freestyle because i was so sore and barely pumping any milk i m an exclusive pumper floor my daughter since she couldn t breastfeed so this was of huge concern for me at the advice of a friend to switch pumps i did research and found this it s apparently discontinued so i got it for cheaper from the first use pumping ess much more comfortable on my nipples and i pumped out almost 3 times as much milk in half the time it took me with the medela i know lots of people who love medela but it just wasn t for me this pump is much louder but who cares i also bought the manual version for when i go back to work which also works great thank god for this pump 
5 4 we were looking for as light weight and padded a mirror as we could find this one works and is easy to install on the headrest mirror isn t as clear as others we saw but it did seem to be the lightest weight and 34 safest 34 we could find 
5 1 fits iphone 6 plus perfectly but one of the diamonds fell out and i keep having to use super glue about once a week because the chain of diamonds on the border keep come bf loose very pretty but i think it should not be used as an every day case 
5 5 arrived on time brandnew and packaged well complete wish there was a choice of what colour i wanted but i m fine with the product 
5 5 great teether
5 5 very nice very big and with a plug so you don t have to break it can t wait to give it to my great grandson for christmas 
5 5 bought this for my baby girl and i love it sure to be a favorite 
5 5 great price will buy again and again for nieces that are born in this family she loved it 
5 1 i can t see my baby when i use it
5 4 i bought this for my daughter who wouldn t spoon feed and likes to do it her self she totally loves it the only problem is when it s not stuffed full she had a hard time getting the rest out but i do love this way better than the other self feeding options on there 
5 5 really helpfull
5 5 item was as described fast shipping 
5 5 really cozy love it
5 5 very cute and stylish my daughters favorite brand 
5 1 great set for a 3 month old baby it assists her mom with carrying all the essentials with room for other nonsensical items 
5 5 for the newest texans fans this teether gets the job done while letting everyone know that 34 this baby is a texans fan 34 go texans 
5 5 love this organizer i use it on my stroller but the adjustable straps make it a perfect fit for the back of a car seat or even the handlebars of a bike i actually use this organizer to keep my wallet keys and phone close as well as baby s needs while i m shopping so much easier than digging through my purse or the diaper bag when i need something 
5 5 does the job as expected 
5 5 loved it
5 5 works wonders on a cranky baby highly recommended for any new mom or grandma a must for the nursery 
3 4 i like it but it s not the two front teeth it s the mouth with teeth still playful and cute 
5 5 i have a new grandniece i bought these pacifiers along with some others of a different brand every time i saw her she had this same pacifier so i asked the parents why were they changing up the pacifiers and they said that this is the baby s favorite pacifier who knew 
5 4 these binkies worked the best for my kids from 0 3 months would recommend to anyone 
5 5 very cute my baby love this pacifier 
4 4 nice concept but only negative is that you can t sterilize it daily
5 1 none available 
5 5 so cute
5 5 they r great
5 5 good
5 5 my son s favorite paci glow in the dark is the best easy for both of us to find lol 
5 5 the best pacifiers for newborns i had 2 in each room of the house when my son was a baby they work like a charm 
5 5 thanks
5 5 she loves it :)
4 4 when colors vary they should be gender neutral it isn t a huge deal but it d be nice mine were hot pink and lime green 
5 5 my 3rd child is a pacifier baby didn t need one with my first two i have tried dozens of them from dr browns to nuk to first years and so on this is the best pacifier hands down my son loves it and it stays in his mouth no funny marks from the pacifiers that have the harder outer ring that suctions to your babies face these avent pacifiers are bpa free which is the only way to go i m very particular about what my baby puts in his mouth product wise he s got a very hard sucking action to him and i am now using the 3 month and older pacifier but let me tell you you will never go back to another pacifier after purchasing these way to go avent great product bpa free great design that leaves no facial marks either the best 
4 4 everything is great but i just hate that handle it is just huge but this is the only pacifier my baby likes 
5 5 wubb goes everywhere with my daughter the lamb doll is adorable and has enabled her to pick up her own pacifier and self soothe from the time she was a very small bundle 
5 4 awesome
5 2 the mess net is a pain to clean and i have not found a good way to clean it yet food always seems to be stuck even after cleaning it you have to make sure that the mess is 100 dry before you put the cover on it i find it hard to open and close i will say that my son does love using it and i think that s really what matters 
5 5 this is the same brand pacifier that was given to my daughter at the hospital so when we lost it we just got some more and my daughter loves them
4 4 took 1 month to get it but great product and price do not order if you need quick 
5 2 snap keeps coming undone and have almost lost it several times 
5 5 great for holding my extra pacifier
4 4 product was smaller than expected but baby seems to like it
5 5 another pacifier guaranteed to get laughs while keeping baby quiet
5 5 adorable 
5 5 really cute my grandson loves it i love it because it doesn t get lost as easily as other pacifiers he can hold onto it find it easily 
5 5 love these pacifiers 
5 5 my daughter prefers these to any other brand
5 5 took my 4 week old a couple of days to get use to the wubbanub because it fit alittle different in his mouth but now we love it so much easier to find than and looses it so much less than without this on there 
5 5 great item 
4 4 great for the price cute activity for a baby shower but the mask is garbage yes you have to cut everything out but that is to be expected just plan on using a scarf instead of the mask 
5 5 they are very nice pacifiers my babies love them and they wash up nicely 
5 5 dude these things really glow bright they are also a good size cute and i love that they glow in the dark 
5 5 love these i got the wrong size but it will do for now 
5 5 loved it 
5 5 loved it 
5 5 these are great good size cute design 
5 5 love these 
5 5 love this pacifier it doesn t get lost as easily as other pacifiers my grandson can find it hold onto it a lot more easily than regular pacifiers 
5 5 this is amazing my daughter had problems holding a pacifier in her mouth and couldn t yet pick it up to put it back in well she could hug the lamb and it would stay in i would highly reconnect this to anyone with a little one 
5 5 perfect a little big for newborns but at least he can keep it in his mouth better than the rounded ones 
5 5 my granddaughter loves this pacifier and it is so cute 
5 5 my grandson loves this so do i it s easy to find grab when he s upset it doesn t get lost as easily as a plain pacifier 
5 5 these are the only pacifiers she ll use 
5 5 the best pacifiers ever they are rounded away from the face so you don t get a ring around the mouth mark like most traditional pacifiers this is the only one my son likes now 
5 4 toy looks good it is a shower gift
5 5 my baby loves this and hold onto it it s definitely a soother and the variety of animals is great 
5 4 baby likes it
5 5 smell really nice i love the vanilla scent 
5 5 super easy to wash as you can just throw it in the washing machine my 11 month old son cannot sleep with out this and bonus now that he s older if he wakes up at night he feels around his crib for this monkey and can put it in himself 
5 5 my kids just love it easy to hold and find at night and day 
5 2 they are very hard 
5 5 this is our 4th wubbanub these are awesome pacifiers for babies who prefer the soothie brand pacifier they don t fall out of the crib and are quite cute dangling from baby s mouth for new parents contemplating this item buy 2 at a time one for current use when the other is in the wash because it got spaghetti sauce on it or fell on a dirty floor it is important to note too as other reviews have mentioned the pacifier does not detach from the stuffed animal the pacifier is sewn to the animal and can easily be thrown in the laundry and then air dried 
5 5 pretty quick shipping and very adorable glad i purchased thanks 
5 5 great product nice package good price 
4 4 i wanted to say that these things suck but that would be a lie they are suckable which is a good thing baby seems to like it 
5 5  
5 5 came on time kid looked mad funny using it 
5 4 good product can get them much cheaper via baby store with a coupon also prefer the perfect 34 version to avoid dental problems but these do the trick when your looking for one of the twenty pacifiers you have lost all over the house 
5 3 the shape and brand and texture are the same as the one i received from the hospital but the color to this one is a slightly lighter orange more translucent than the one i received at the hospital i gave it three stars because for some reason my daughter can tell the difference between these and the one from the hospital i put this one in her mouth and she makes a face and spits it out and yes i did wash it before i used it she prefers the one from hospital one i can t figure out why because they seem the same to me 
5 5 i love wubbanub pacifiers now my daughter learned how to hold them by two months of age and loves snuggling with them i especially love that it holds the pacifier up as well 
5 5 my daughter would not take the regular 34 soothies 34 pacifiers our older daughter loved those we tried these because they were a tad smaller both in length and circumference and she preferred these good deal to buy 5 right off the bat instead of those single or 2 packs 
5 5  60 3 the paci s
5 5 we keep this strapped to the baby s carseat so we are never far from a clean pacifier in public great concept it never opens on it s own has a good lock to it 
5 5 very nice product makes a nice baby shower gift 
5 5 bought this as a gift for my niece she is older in first grade but has seizure disorder triggered by stress and sucking on a pacifier helps calm her down and prevent seizing this plushie helps her 34 normalize 34 having the binkie and is helping her learn to use the plushie to calm down instead of the binkie she loves the pattern and color too 
5 5 these pacifiers are one of the better all around designs we ve found the cutout for the nose means our daughter does not spit it out as much and the nipple is soft enough but substantial enough to keep her interested an added loop makes it easy to attach a strap or more importantly loop around your finger during the inevitable hold where baby is refusing the clear plastic also makes it easy to see if something is on it or if it s worth cleaning 
5 5 i think is the best pacifier in the market
5 5 i use this every day at work 
5 3 i thought these worked really well until i tried some different brands it turns out my daughter spit these out a lot easier than the others 
5 5 i can t say enough good about this pacifier i had planned on not using a pacifier with my daughter due to my firstborn s heavy attachment to his however she started wanting to nurse 24 7 a couple weeks after she was born so i finally broke down and bought her a paci it became clear very quickly that she wanted nothing to do with one i tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her i was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast like pacifier was and was led to this one i placed my order right away and as soon as it was delivered i opened it up boiled it and presented it to my daughter she didn t care for it until she got a little upset later on but then she took it right away she definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast but she has accepted the pacifier as an 34 okay 34 substitute until boob becomes more convenient soooo i strongly recommend that any breastfeeding mothers try this pacifier if you need a bit of a break 
5 5 my son loved this pacifier as an infant but it took a long time to break him away from it overall it was great comfort for him 
5 3 larger than the others we have had but still a fabulous idea easy to wash in the washing machine in mesh bag and let air dry my daughter is obsessed 
5 5 my loves loves this product fast shipping
5 5 my baby girl like it 
5 4 great shower present friend loved it
5 5 my baby loves these and they never get lost at night because they glow 
5 5 love this wubbanub 
5 5 delivered in a decent amount if time cute little packaging and an adorable print 
5 5 the best pacifier ever they are great for the itty bitty ones i can prop them on the babies belly and they can find them much eaisier that way then when baby gets older they can find them better in the crib 
5 5 totally love
5 5 good value
5 5 baby loves it i recommend getting two or more so you will have a backup in case his favorite gets lost 
5 5 it s a favorite and seconds as a plush to hold on to 
5 5 i laugh every time i see them 
4 5 good but leaves a mark on the face
5 5 ordered extra
5 5 thank you
5 5 my daughter loves her little lamb this is a staple in our house and do yourself a favor and buy a couple in case you misplace it 
5 5 i would always drop the pacifier and have to dispose of them but now it stays protected such a clever idea for mothers and never gets lost 
5 5 met expectations
5 5 great very helpful and the delivery time even to brazil it was great 
5 3 my daughter loves wubbanubs this one is bigger than the others she s had 
5 5 very happy with this purchase wubba is grandson s favorite :)
5 2 we got these pacifiers from the stadium and my son only liked these ones we lost one and knew we needed more so i ordered these the symbol came off in less than one day the one we have been using for months is still on there he still enjoys them but it is a bummer the logo isnt on there 
4 4 it s great to find translucent pacifiers for older babies toddlers my baby prefers the nipples on the philips brand pacifiers over any other however these unlike the philips 34 freeflow 34 do have a 34 right side up 34 because of the way the outer plastic is shaped as some other comments have noted for that reason i ll stick with the 34 freeflow 34 ones despite the colors 
5 5 yellow was on sale 
5 5 cute
5 4 i think these are very good pacifiers they were my sons favorite when he was 0 3 months he is now 5 months and does not care for pacifiers that much anymore i would recommend these to anyone with a newborn as their first pacifiers 
5 4 i love how these glow in the dark these were my sons favorite pacifier besides his soothies i recommend this product especially the glow in the dark ones because they look so cute 
5 5 kid loves these 
5 5 this is so cute very good quality 
5 5 purchased these to add to our collection of mam bottles they work so much better than 34 normal 34 bottles 
5 4 my daughter is still too little to understand this concept she s 2 1 2 months so we put it away until she s a little bigger but the elephant is adorable and seems like the perfect size
5 5 my nephew loves this
5 5 the babe loves the bottles and the pacifier matches the bottle nipples perfectly happy baby happy mommy happy family 
5 5 love this very cute stylish 
5 5 i loved it just as expected 
4 4 great gag gift my son did not necessarily enjoy the shape of the pacifier but for only a few bucks it was a nice purchase 
5 5 this is my grandbaby s favorite pacifier and we tried several from other companies thank you for giving her something to hold onto now we have three so if she loses one there is one waiting 
4 4 i like the fact that it s all natural with no plastic crap our little man wasn t very interested in using it though i guess mama s nipple is more satisfying than rubber tree sap 
5 5 we bought this to keep my son from launching his pacifier across the room when he ejected it it is cute and at 3 months he likes to stroke the kitty s head and sometimes grabs the ears sometimes he puts the kitty s foot in his mouth 
5 5 the only pacifier that our baby liked
5 5 adorable can t wait to meet my nephew and see him with a little mustache the pics will be priceless 
5 5 nice product 
5 5 i have given several of these as baby shower gifts they are cute and useful 
5 5 great quality 
5 4 good quality 
5 5 we ve been very happy with this so far works very well it lights up and gives very accurate readings very user friendly we ve used it a few times we ve never had trouble with her taking it or keeping it in her mouth 
5 5 very good pacifiers the only my baby loves used it from 6 months to 18 months easy to clean in dishwasher
5 5 my 1 month old daughter absolutely loves this 
5 5 this is so funny and cute :)
5 5 my daughter loves these we have had about six of these 
3 3 should have put the open latch on the other side verse between the clamp side makes it hard to open while clamped
5 5 these are so useful for night because you can easily see them in the dark also useful for long plane trips hold the pacifier in bright light for a minute to recharge the glow it will glow all night 
5 4 i bought these along with another brand of bpa free pacifier and while i like the closed design of the other brand no water gets in when you wash them my baby can keep these nuks in his mouth better they would be perfect if they were closed like the other brand with no crevaces for germs and water to get into but id still buy these nuks again 
5 5 my daughter loves these they are a couple dollars cheaper on here
5 5 very good
3 2 the fact that it was natural convinced me to buy it but my baby didn t like it at all 
5 2 you cant use in the bottle warmer 
5 5 this little lamb is so cute it is my granddaughter s favorite pacifier she loves holding it it also comes apart so you can wash the lamb in the washer which is nice cause it definitely gets dirty 
5 5 babies love wubbanubs 
5 2 the baby didn t like this one at all and he s pretty non discriminatory when it comes to such things 
5 5 love these pacifiers before he was born i got three types nuk soothies and mam to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby nuk was immediately rejected and he was so content with the mam that we skipped the soothies and gave them to the neighbor he seems to like the less molded shape of the mam nipple and has been a happy camper since we ve found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib he ll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced usually by you at 4am the only thing i don t like is that the shield part on this style seem awfully big and cover a large part of his face for that reason we used the smaller size ones long after 6 months and have just now 9 months introduced the 6 months size 
5 5 only pacifiers she ll take gags on everything else due to her cleft of the soft palate 
5 5 i have purchased these pacifiers so many times they are great for once baby is rolling around once my daughter was only enough and rolling in her sleep it was nice that these would stay in because they are rounded my daughter prefers these pacifiers to the nuk which i could never get her to take the part that goes in baby s mouth is just like what most hospitals give so it was a seamless transition 
5 5 my kid loves it 
5 5 great service and product 
5 5 babies love wubbanubs 
5 5 these are the best 
5 5 love these pacifiers before he was born i got three types nuk soothies and mam to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby nuk was immediately rejected and he was so content with the mam that we skipped the soothies and gave them to the neighbor he seems to like the less molded shape of the mam nipple and has been a happy camper since i m not so impressed with the glow in the dark because they seem to not glow after an hour or two even though i set them on the windowsill during the day however we ve found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib he ll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced usually by you at 4am thanks mam 
4 1 junky little stuffed toy cannot detach the pacifier
4 4 nice pacifiers i like the glow in the dark handles and the caps to keep them clean on the go one down side is that the plastic is flat unlike some pacifiers that are rounded we also use mam pacifiers to be more comfortable for the baby our son doesn t seem to mind too much but it does take him a bit to get used to that if he s been using the others 
5 5 babies love wubbanubs 
4 5 hysterically cute not sure how well it works as it was a gift but it sure was well received 
5 5 oh my lord this little guy is ubber adorable and tiny my second baby is not here yet but the item appears well made and is very soft and adorable 
5 5 i am breastfeeding my daughter and it seemed like she hated every bottle i tried to give to her except this one i noticed this one she doesnt burp or spit up as bad i love them
5 5 my daughter loves mam pacifiers and i bought these to help her find them in the crib at night i leave them on the kitchen counter while i make dinner and get her ready for bed about an hour and they glow all night long it s actually pretty impressive and it does seem to help her 
5 5 what a great deal on something that you ll always need tons of and they are great bright colors i am so happy that i found these and free 2 day shipping so helpful 
5 3 not as high quality as described brought as a gift and the cap does not even fit onto the pacifier packaging is very cheap as well 
5 3 i love this item and think its so cute for babies only thing i can complain about is that i ordered brown2 but got brown1 it is just as cute but i feel that if you order something you should get just what you ordered 
3 4 i tihnk these are a little overpriced but a good concept
5 5 what we love about this pacifier is that there is no plastic handle that flops around we have a few other pacifiers that have the plastic handles and our child does not seem to like the sound or something these are nice because the handle stays stationary and is easy for the baby to hold onto 
5 5 we were happy with the new born chicco pacifiers so when our baby grew out of that size we just stuck with the same product my wife and i love this design and so does our little one just like the 0 pacifier the greatest feature of this design is the stationary handle made out of rubber 
5 3 baby didn t like these and we kept using the blue silicone pacifiers from the hospital these hit her nose weird 
5 1 my daughter is 5 mo old and this pacifier is way to big for her mouth it chokes her i don t understand how any baby could use this because i haven t had any problems with any other nipple or pacifier she uses soothies on a regular basis but has tried various other normal pacifiera and had no issues size 2 dr brown s bottles don t affect her this way either the nipple is way too long 
5 5 every baby seems to have their preferences for pacifiers but this one stuck after we tried the soothie and mam we used the soothie when she was a newborn and then transitioned to this one at around 2 months we found this one to be the easiest for her to keep in her mouth now she s 7 months and the little handles have become quite a toy for her to play with so she pulls it out of her mouth readily but i imagine that would be the case with any brand 
5 5 similar to pacifiers from hospital
4 4 this is the first one i bought for some reason i thought it would be bigger which isn t a problem but one thing i did not like is that pacifiers are sown on to the wubbanub so if the pacifier gets damaged you have to buy a whole new one that s the only reason i gave it 4 stars i like it though
5 5 love this mustachifier of which i also bought a tuxedo onesie to go with it when the parents needed a must dresses outfit really cool 
5 5 love our wubbanub my little uses it to cuddle and it makes it a lot harder to lose 
5 5 wonderful
5 5 we gave this to our daughter when she was just weeks old and it is still her go to comforter at 10 months i first saw it when my friends little boy had one and she swore by it the best thing about this pacifier is it s ability to keep the pacifier from bouncing all over the floor when it is dropped it is all very 34 baby friendly 34 in that my daughter could grab it with her hands at a very early age and keep hold of it my plan to transition will be to remove the pacifier and give her the doggie if i can remove it without destroying doggie on another note we bought a spare duck one but it fell apart animal came off within 3 weeks we then got a spare clifford which seems just as good as the brown puppy the only negative is that many daycares will not allow them tough because of sids risk with any stuffed animals in crib 
5 5 i love my mam products they are so easy to clean and the microwave sanitation was a life saver when we went on vacations since almost every hotel has a microwave and i didn t have to bring along things to clean them with they have held up very nice over the last almost eight months my daughter has used them she loved these bottles straight from the start even with me breast feeding at first she took these right away they do leak often but i have come to realize it s almost impossible to find a bottle that doesn t leak i also use the pacifiers by mam and she loved those as well 
5 5 my grandson will not let go of this 
5 5 wonderful
5 5 well worth the money
5 5 great
4 3 works great but the only issue is that it is a little hard to open 
1 2 not large enough for a baby tote bag need to return the item pattern and color not attractive 
5 5 safely holds pacifier and keeps it out of the dirt until it is needed 
5 5 i m a nicu nurse and these are great i always buy them for my friends when they have a baby and people rave about the fact that it keeps the pacifier in the mouth or at least off the ground i love them 
5 4 great product works as well as the 50 thermometer
5 1 my baby did not like these she is 6 months have tried several times threw them out she likes wubbanubs 
5 4 i m a sucker for anything featuring the british flag upon seeing this set i had to get it my only complaint it s a classic bottle i don t understand why avent classic bottles have three pieces main bottle nipple and the stupid inside ring it s just a pain 
5 5 a very cute and meaningful pacifier makes baby content makes adults giggle 
5 5 i got this as a baby gift for a friend hopefully her and her baby will love it my little girl has 4 and is completely attached to them these wubbanub s are magic 
5 1 too expensive for this quality
5 5 these funny little pacifier animal combos have been a lifesaver they generally stay in baby s mouth a little longer than a standard pacifier and give her something to hold on to the attached pacifier is a soothie which is the only type of pacifier our daughter would take i also got a few extra soothies to stick in the diaper bag for emergencies not to mention these wubbanubs look adorable our favorite is the giraffe if you ever happen to run into him ours is named carl this was featured on my top 10 items for baby list 
4 4 this is super cute the downside is that i expected it to be a little more weighted to keep the pacifier from getting pushed out it is useful that the baby can hold the owl so i guess we will just have to wait a little bit for him to grow more and it will work great 
5 5 best 
5 5 i love these they help prevent the dreaded 34 binky rash 34 
5 5 best invention ever 
5 5 my daughter loves these pacifiers and won t use anything else
5 5 these are the best pacifiers we own inexpensive no frills and more effective than all the others we ve tried 
5 5 these are great real hard plastic that my little puppy can t gnaw through when he steals them these are the only ones i ve found that are stronger than him 
5 2 so disappointed with a recent order of these pacifiers my newest baby had been using one from two years ago 2012 that my older child never used we love the old one sturdy thick quality rubber darker amber color matte look feel perfectly molded though after 3 months of consistent use it has started to wear down disintegrate but this new 2 pack i just received is nothing like the ones from two years ago they re cheap feeling flimsy thinner shiny the edges are ragged with extra rubber pieces i m so let down because we ve loved our old natursutten so much the old one is so rich looking the new style is no better than the cheap ones from the grocery store sad 
5 5 i really is what i expected
5 4 we tried these because they were the only pacifiers our daughter will use but our son isn t as crazy about them as she is they don t seem hard enough for him if i put my finger through the back of the nipple and he closes down on my finger he is satisfied 
5 5 my baby like it 
5 5 love these things toy and pacifier in one awesome
5 5 fantastic 
5 5 my 2 month old takes them and i am happy knowing my baby has a natural material product in her mouth i only use the pacifier to help me in the car because i don t want to hear her wail anyway spend the extra bucks and avoid plastic and synthetics i sterilize by 5 min in boiling water ;)
5 5 bought for grandson transferred to granddaughter i did not realize from picture this item has pink floral under bod my son with male child forwarded to son with daughter she loves it no longer white loved too much 
5 5 loves it
5 5 super cute it will look like he is a little man
5 5 value pack my little girl loves nuk and they are one of the best pacifiers on the market 
5 1 too heavy to keep in grandson s mouth 
5 5 before teething my baby never liked it now she loved loved loved it best thing ever 
5 5 son isn t a pacifier baby but when he does want one this is it he just loves it over the others we bought 
5 5 very good 
5 5 baby finds binky at night happy mom enough said 
5 5 i ve gone through many pacifiers over the years and these are top notch the handle is ideal as it s very important to know where the pacifier is at all times so i always seem to slip it on my finger like a ring if not in use there is no water getting inside from saliva etc and that makes it feel much cleaner and more sterile soft silicone seems to be easy to suck on and keep the babies happy 
5 4 good deal
5 5 and we like how they glow in the dark now that she is finding them and putting them back in her mouth the glow in the dark feature comes in handy they work best when left under a light for a while 
5 5 a must
5 5 love the pink color of these 3 month pacifiers i am not sure what the difference is between the 0 3 and 3 months besides a thicker ring around the part that goes in the mouth otherwise they seem like they are the same size either way this pacifier is a great product that my baby loves 
5 5 nice product baby never used it baby daddy is raider fan lol
5 5 love this one 
5 5 i love this binky since it is attached to a monkey i never lose it the monkey allowed me to 34 prop 34 it up so it stayed in my sons mouth and it s heavy enough that he didn t spit it out for fun but could remove it if he wanted to i have washed it a couple of times by throwing it in the washing machine and it was basically dry when i took it out my son chewed through the first binky after several months so i bought a second one after he chewed through that one i went to the store and bought the same brand of binkies but instead of the newborn ones i got the 9 mo i think and removed the old ones and sewed in the new ones now i have backups and since he is done teething he hasn t chewed through any more 
5 5 my 3 month old loves his monkey well worth it 
5 1 unfornatelly this item did not meet my expectation i choose the pacifier for girls and i received this pacifier for boys how does amazon can help with this issue 
5 5 was a very precious addition to our baby shower 
5 4 work great and great idea in theory but they hardly get used because if the baby drops their pacifier and your not right by the wipes then it is easier to wash in a sink i recoment getting the portable package of pacifiers or getting enough of these that you can put them in multiple places through the house
5 4 these pacifiers are great they don t really glow but they are very cute and durable 
5 2 only good when baby is 1 3 month according to my dentist this breast shape pacifier may lead to some teeth problem to babies when intensively used the flat one is better and recommend 
5 5 cute
5 5 this is my husband s account but i had to come on and give a review these pacifiers are great they are hard to lose because of their size our daughter who is almost 5 months old is starting to learn how to guide it to her mouth because its big enough for her to grab she also uses the rim of the pacifier to chew on because she s teething so that s an added bonus in my book i would highly recommend 
1 1 worst dont buy the plastic is too hard 
5 5 every single wubby we have owned has been great love the wubbanub 
5 5 great quality product 
5 5 adorable 
5 5 only ones my daughter will use best price ever 
5 5 bueno
5 1 the letters princess are written in grey not in black as showed at the photo
5 5 excellent 
5 5 love them 
5 5 my baby boy loves these he uses them all the time when he wakes up in the middle of the night i give him the pacifier and he goes right back to sleep also when he is crying he stops crying when i give him the pacifier its also nice that it glows highly recommend to all mommies with babies these are the only pacifiers that my baby liked i bought him other pacifiers from other brands and he doesn t like them these are the only ones so far that he likes 
5 5 great 
5 5 love it
1 1 product states that it is a 0 6 month product arrived and was 0 3 months contacted company who did not respond to my complaint 
5 5 great service love this pacifier
5 5 funny
5 4 they are great grandson loves it
5 5 my breast fed baby will only take these i wasted a lot of money on several brands of pacifier and gave up thinking my baby just wouldn t take one my niece was born the following week and one night in the middle of the night i was messaging with my sister in law and she messaged me a picture of the mam the pacifier that my niece had started taking reliably i thought whatever it probably still won t work but we bought some anyway and lo and behold so now we have three sets pink yellow and the green glow in the dark we also have the 6 mos ones in a drawer ready to go which are the same but with a longer nipple love our mam 
5 5 these pacifier buddies help to keep the pacifier from falling off the baby s chest 
5 5 my baby loves this pacifier 
5 4 yes they are always good the smallest of babies seem to have the ability to keep it in their mouth longer 
3 4 these pacifiers are as good as the regular avent ones however they do have the little groove on top which will require you or the child turning it around if they are wanting to chew or play with the pacifier at times the glowing handle is fun for my 18mth old as it s something to focus on at night the glow does not last long however it s very quick to pick up light to when 34 recharging 34 
5 5 my son loves this 
5 5 these are the best bottle out there for our baby this is the only nipple shape our daughter will take i was surprised that there are no other bottles with this nipple shape i like the venting feature of these bottles and i like that there aren t too many pieces to clean like the dr brown s bottles i used for our first daughter what a nightmare to clean these bottles only have 3 large pieces to each bottle in addition to the nipple and ring it does not require any kind of special cleaning brush they vent wonderfully i like that you get two different sized bottles and two pacifiers for 20 you can t go wrong with this gift set to buy each piece individually at the store would cost about 30 you do have to be careful with the temperature of your milk formula if it s too hot these bottles will leak also since these bottles are very thick it takes a long time to warm up contents inside the bottle i prefer to warm up milk or formula in a breast milk storage bottle and then dump it into the mam bottle when it s warm 
5 5 excelente
5 4 delivery took forever i had to message the seller to ask them to ship it sooner the delivery estimate was wrong if we knew how long it would take to just get the mattress on the road we would ve paid for shipping 1 starthe mattress itself fits my daughter s cosco play yard perfectly no gaps on the sides the mattress is a bit on the firm side but it makes it easy for her to crawl and stand up mattress cover is kinda crunchy which adds to the firmness of the mattress 
5 4 great tools 
4 3 worked well with my baby only downside is that it would frequently become loose while feeding but with this i was able to breastfeed my baby 
3 4 i wanted to try the snap in insert and it was better than i thought however i prefer the pockets this was nice and soft on the inside too it s a super cute print too 
5 5 cute and seems to repel pee 
5 1 annoying and loud same as a dog toy 
5 4 works good on the floor as a bath toy caddy i have never tried to put it on the wall 
5 5 this is such a cool product i got this as a baby gift for one of my friends that has a small child under 2 and also has one that is not quite a year she is the kind of mom that makes her own baby food she likes that she controls what is in her child s food you can freeze this and just pop out what you need you can also write on the top what is inside because it cleans up easy when you wash it this is the perfect gift for her 
1 3 do not buy it if you are using the natural bottles coz it can not hold 4 natural bottles and their nipples at the same time i have to do twice every time 
5 5 my baby loves this soother when we put him down in his crib we always turn it on and he loves to stare at it and sometimes gets up and kisses it he loves his nemo the ocean sounds are also great and seem to sooth baby to sleep once he s done with all the kissing and staring 
5 5 these work excellently in tandem with our cloth diapers 
5 5 worked wonderful very sturdy 
4 3 this worked well for my son for just a few months however with all of his squirming the shoulder straps broke within 3 months of daily use 
4 4 definitely large for a bag but i really like the soft top where baby puts his hand in too many of these cups have awkward plastic openings that i find too rough for a baby s hand 
5 5 fantastic high chair extremely portable and easy to clean best one on the market
5 5 very good
5 4 these bibs are awesome except now my son can pull the bib off because the closing is not secure if they changed that part this bib would be perfect 
5 5 i purchased these for my daughter to use when drying her face after washing they make great facial clothes because they are so soft 
5 4 it is what it is my child loves it so i bought a spare just in case kind of expensive for what it is but if it works just get it 
5 5 this is the best thing for young parents to have for their babies sounds gross but it works so well and no you don t get anything back into your mouth gently sucks out their little noses well my daughter and daughter in laws all love it can t afford to be without one in your home when you have a young one that can t blow their nose yet 
5 5 these valves work really well in preventing spills 
5 5 works great and good price recommend 
5 4 different textures are fun for baby
5 5 great price for a great chair nice and light but sturdy easy to clean my daughter is 8 months old and loves to sit in it and eat her finger foods in the kitchen while i cook she s small for her age and the seat fits her much better than her high chair highly recommend for travel and home user 
5 5 good size for little hands to hold good quality nice bright colors gave to my grandson at 6 months and he still chooses them to play with at almost 9 months 
5 2 very cheaply made 
5 5 when i first started pumping i cut holes into an old sports bra to use as a pumping bra it worked but it was super annoying to use at work who wants to pull a sports bra on and off two to three times a day at work i m so glad i ended up buying this it zips up so i don t have to pull off my shirt or my regular nursing bra to get it positioned the sizing is adjustable that s why you buy the size s xl there s an adjustable panel on the back so it can fit just about any size i am currently about a 36b 36c depending on the bra brand this is my nursing bra size this fits great and really does allow me to do other things while i m pumping 
5 3 we ve been using this seat for several months now and while it does the job for the price point i do think both chicco and britax make superior seats if you have the money furthermore now going into colder weather i m finding it very difficult to find a warm enough cover that properly fits living in one of the coldest continental us climates i m really wishing we would have chose a smaller seat so we would be able to have a warmer cover i mean let s face it one of those blanket style ones isn t nearly warm enough and none of the bunting ones will properly fit i refuse to put our little one in thick clothes in the seat because that strips the seat of any safety features it has anyway in all honesty there s no way you ll be lugging around a baby in this carrier who maxes out the acceptable size rang of this seat anyway my recommendation is that you buy a smaller seat if you will need to use a winter cover 
5 5 i have a slight obsession with trying different bottles and i have to say these have landed at the top of my list my son is 3 months old not colicky and formula fed i wasn t really trying to fix anything like gas or spit up because i feel like he is not excessive with either of those but i just like to see what bottle he seems the most comfortable with i started with medela when i was breastfeeding and the nipples collapsed all the time i tried avent original and it just was annoying and nipple is long imo i tried avent natural which i liked but the air vent in the nipple got punctured when trying to clean milk out of it and then the bottle leaked ugh i tried dr brown and i was happy with those but cleaning all the parts was annoying and since my baby didn t really need all that venting i guess they were pointless to me nuk bottles are horrible you can t even shake your formula to mix it because of how the nipple is tilted playtex new style drop in bottle omg i m not even gonna go there yuck tommee tippe i jus wasn t really a fan of them the nipple seemed to come loose from ring way to easily and i really didn t like the shape i love the lansinoh momma bottle and nipple and so does my baby it is comfortable to hold and he seems very comfy and doesn t have to re adjust his latch or release for air with parent s choice bottles was drawing away from nipple to vent air not good sooooo easy to clean as well with the wide neck and this also makes easy to put formula into bottle i just bought a comotomo bottle and i ll see how that goes 
5 5 i love this wallet holds everything even my checkbook and cell phone great purchase and i would buy again :)
5 5 this is the one to buy as far as toddler step stools go easy for the 4yo to move around and use also sturdy and inexpensive i wish i d bought this one long ago 
3 3 good coverage in the front for little boys but this does not stay positioned on the seat the suction cups do not work 
5 5 fits my dream on me 3 34 spring coil portable crib mattress perfectly loved the design and nice and soft for baby just what i was looking for 
5 5 baby loves it too this bassinet is sooo nice love the cover and the see through mesh our granddaughtercried in the other models without mesh it s sooo easy to assemble and great for people like us with a housefull of pets mattress thin but bought a thicker one works great 
5 4 looks and works great we had to get accustom to stepping over the support that goes across the floor 
2 4 i just bought a britax without the click tight last month i m super annoyed i didn t know this was coming out because the latch is a pain in the neck to install when you are small like i am i can t spend another couple hundred dollars on a new seat though :(
5 5 great product baby loves it non stop
5 5 this is an essential baby product it makes bath time so much easier and fun 
5 1 this only fits siliskin brand cup no one has cups that are what they call 34 standard 34 that would be a 2 34 diameter cup i didn t even bother returning it it s just a random toy getting kicked around it s a great idea if it had some more stretch to it and actually fit several sizes of glasses 
5 5 they look amazing love it
5 5 cute then cute now my toddlers love their skip hop zoo lunch bags held up well for over a year and still going strong would definitely recommend 
5 1 this book is a joke my 10 month old loves the lamaze books but when i received this the book smelled of mold i have since washed it and still smells i thumbed through the book only to see major errors the word 34 kitty 34 written upside down the word 34 puppy 34 was written on the outside of the flap when it was supposed to be inside ya know so it can be a 34 peekaboo 34 book completely dissatisfied with this purchase do not buy 
5 5 i bought this for my first grandchild and he and his mother love it she told me she doesn t know what she d do without it he is 15 months now and has to use it every night i m so happy that we found it 
5 4 very cute and good product
5 5 these are hands down my favorite swaddle blankets out there they are slightly thinner than my aden anais blankets but they have a little more give and are easily 10x softer after a wash or two they become buttery soft we won t buy any other brand the size is perfect too i won t waste my money on smaller blankets anymore i can get a great tight swaddle with these and they make the perfect lightweight nursing cover my oldest now uses his as a security blankie 
1 1 i boiled these to sterilize them after they arrived and the water had a thick oily slime after boiling i am not sure why but it makes me concerned about the manufacturing process and safety of the product 
5 3 this basket does what it says but if you use wide neck bottles and nipples then this product is useless i use both wide neck and normal and can only put my normal bottles in the dish washer i wish i had known before purchasing it has held up well in the dishwasher and am happy at the durability 
3 5 not s nice as i expected but ok
5 4 this is still a project in progress we originally bought this one because it wasn t worth the money to spend on a character potty the first day we brought it home my son wanted nothing to do with it so i read online for some potty training tips and found that some parents let their children decorate the potty we bought some thomas the train stickers and let our son cover this thing with thomas and his friends and now he loves it in the end i m glad we ended up going with this one saving the money and letting our son experience the process of making this his own 
5 5 these are excellent seats highly rated from both a safety standpoint and consumer happiness we have twins and had to buy two of these they re not the slimmest form but they re not the widest either in my 2013 wrangler unlimited 4 door wrangler they take up a good portion of the back seat but still leave enough room for our 8 year old daughter to reach the seat belt latch in my wife s 2011 durango they don t take up so much real estate that it makes my daughter uncomfortable to sit in the middle row but the base does extend a bit over her latch and she has to push the seats aside in order to buckle her belt which isn t easy to do considering how tight they re strapped to the seat our boys are only 16 months old so they re still rear facing the comfort safety features and even the design are top notch the boys are happy and comfortable and my wife and i are happy knowing they re safe 
5 5 gift loved
5 4 really nicely constructed bag that fits the b agile perfectly we have used it on 2 flights for gate checked stroller and it has worked well 
5 5 the costume was just darling my granddaughter received so many compliments 
1 1 i loved this walker at first and then 2 months down the line the back wheels stopped rotating apparently if you have animals of any sort or high pile carpet the hair gets in the rivets and there is no way to get it out we tried everything from tweezers to needle nose pliers but the hair was so far in there we couldn t reach it i called the joovy company and he suggested similar things to remove the hair and when i told him i had already tried those things he simply said 34 sorry i am all out of ideas good luck 34 i will not buy joovy again the cost was high to begin with but i was always a firm believer of 34 you get what you pay for 34 not this time don t do it 
4 4 good purchase gave it 4 stars because the nightlight isn t very bright and when nightlight is off the nightlight button is lite up and entirely too bright 
5 5 one of my nine month old s favorite toys great quality keeps him busy 
5 5 i knew i needed to buy one but i had been putting it off for a long time i just wasn t sure i was ready to commit to filling it day in and day out and what if i didn t like it i knew i wouldn t send it back and it would just sit in the basement collecting dust next to my ab lounger and thigh master but then one day i looked in the mirror and i didn t like what i was seeing my skin was dry my eyes red and my hair looked like i stuck my finger into an electrical socket the final straw happened later that day when i bent down to pet my cat and the shock from the static electricity nearly killed my dear muffin that was the moment i decided to take the plunge and plunge i did i got right on amazon and ordered myself the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier in blue bc i knew if i stuck with it each day that there would be a special man in my life eventually and i wanted him to not only accept my safety 1st humidifier but to grow to love it it was not long before things started turning around for me no more flaking skin and fly away hair and men who never gave me a second glance started saying 34 good morning 34 in the elevator at work i m happy to report that 11 months later my life has completely changed for the better i m now married and we re expecting our first child a boy and yes the safety 1st ultrasonic 360 humidifier will be on our baby registry 
5 5 very solid stroller and easy to maneuver i can maneuver it with one hand if i need to and it can make tight turns absorbs bumps very well love that i can face my infant and toddler to each other and they love that too i have a ford focus sedan and the stroller fits in the trunk however i do have to take off the snack tray on the front seat which isn t a big problem it s easy to open and close nothing complex and it s fast to do it actually does stand up on it s own when closed some people will complain that it s too long but i don t find it so it has to be long enough to fit two children and i d rather have it long than wide i always get compliments on the stroller when i m out 
5 5 great fun for my granddaughter 
5 4 this is a great potty seat especially if you have a higher toilet it fits very secure and stable it folds in half for easy storage 
5 4 just like the old days with my kids pricey but they don t break when dropped like the hard plastic ones grandaughter uses very tight lids
5 3 my baby loves it but after a few weeks you could see dirk and moho inside the pacifier 
4 5 i couldn t like this more for my 3 yr old it does drip one tiny drop when first turned upside down but afterwards nothing comes out so it s not 100 leak proof but it does a great job overall 
5 5 very great product for the nursing baby 
5 5 very nice great quality baby loves it
1 1 crap broke
